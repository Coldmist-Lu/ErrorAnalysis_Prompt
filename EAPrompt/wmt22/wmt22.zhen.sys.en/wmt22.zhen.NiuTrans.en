Research results of students singing leading roles at the annual academic conference of Zhejiang University open the human brain - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, judging diseases with breath, and accurately searching for the source of haze Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with large brain holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other fields, students from a curious idea to create a lot of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smartphone side, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is breathe a little, and the instrument can initially detect your health from the composition of the gas you exhale."
According to Zhang, the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands on the market that can detect health generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The biosensor uses a new material, graphene, which targets chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of health.
Smart operating lamp: high-energy eyes of doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of the traditional operating lamp, and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadow-less lamp.
"A lot of diseases early detection, resection is not in place, with doctors operating room lights."
For example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissue in time during early cancer screening, the cancer cells will spread later, Shen said.
The intelligent operating lamp has four discs that adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues in light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow-free rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent operating lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students have invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the installed hand sanitizer, our weight compresses the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and binds to the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, not only to ensure the degree of washing, but also to save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention won the only gold medal among many of the world's top schools.

Okay, it's in trouble
A certificate that feels very meaningful, first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think are important in addition to my driving license!
Popularization: first aid measures are actually doing emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a period of time between the arrival of the ambulance after the accident, and that is the most critical time.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, a brain haemorrhage, and a sudden respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, four minutes of gold!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
The feeling of helplessness that we can use our professional knowledge to rescue someone when they fall down next to us, instead of standing there stupidly motionless and unable to do anything, is too frightening.
"In China, we officially account for three million accidental deaths each year, the most dangerous of which is called cardiac arrest.
Across the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70 to 80 percent can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1 percent. "
This is the First Respond founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you pinch the person is not of any use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person.
I find that few of us now have the awareness to learn first aid, but it's too late when it happens, so I'd like to appeal to all of us to learn this skill so that we can respond in the face of emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
First aid passes can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I was registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, students have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of what you want to accomplish before the age of 25, and it was a few months ago to add the first aid card to the list of goals, but it was done!
Then I want to test other certificates I want to test, I'm going to test a diving license, before I saw in the small Xiaohongshu there is a diving first aid certificate, the test of this card seems to have to have a first aid certificate to go to the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
One of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings!?
I haven't tried
How does #NAME# not write it?
Is it 13 yuan for one?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed food, this time a shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because obviously I saw it was valid when I entered the code
To conclude, I personally think "Only Fools Rush In" is an all-round rotten film, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether the movie is not a bright spot, it's not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of rotten films, so that you can sleep soundly in the cinema is one, so that you are angry after watching it is also one, "Only Fools Rush In" to the audience is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Keshi novel, indescribable, with many loopholes like a trench coat on ponies.
Even after watching it you'll wonder if there's a director's metaphor in it, but when you think about it, it's actually a lump of shit.
Let's start by briefly saying some of the plot that I find difficult to understand.
The male owner should live on a small island in the south, and live with his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranges for a lord in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
The old man is riding a van from the south to the northeast to watch the snow??
He and his father were very reassured about it.
Then the old man did not follow.
How did a woman get her business license when she opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's flying car party gangster easily close a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
The feeling of the props is too obvious.
Why can a small bugger who can't get credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury why not call the police, the film police also specifically asked whether there are difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card at a hotel and then force an arrangement to sit outside the door of the room without finding the owner?
This kind of inexplicable plot permeates the whole film, and because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the main thrust of the film, or that the film has no main thrust at all, which is an abominable stitch-up monster.
At the beginning of the film you will think he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, half of the time you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the survival of the young people in the town is not easy, after watching you do not know what you actually saw, followed by a deep doubt about yourself, why the New Year's go to the cinema to enjoy the stool.
For most people, they are actually familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie steps up to success.
If you want to make a love movie, you're honest about the feud between a small-town youth who loves to ride a motorcycle and a waitress and sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot must not appear to contradict the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's character, whose new motorcycle has just been burned and is still able to sing), cannot open a brain hole that even Kennedy can't see.).
As for the actress who is not mentally retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5-year-old, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
And I can't imagine why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Such a film is arranged in the Spring Festival stall, is it to add a block to the audience?

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the omicron variant of COVID-19 causes a milder disease than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and coughing, similar to flu, AP reported.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have yet to be hospitalized.
"They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." Pillay said
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into severe illness from coronavirus infection.
By contrast, he said, in the last wave of Delta, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days".
In the two weeks after the omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to South Africa's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are severe, half the severity of the previous wave; the average length of stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% of early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying, "At present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease."
He added, "It's still early, and we need late data.
Normally, hospitalisations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospital admissions, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the world's leading COVID-19 strain, omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, with tests showing more than 90% of cases of the omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education commentaries: What does it take to save abducted children?
If the analogy is made with the famous public service slogan "no sale, no killing", then, in a good environment without the demand for "trafficking", mass prevention and control, the whole people anti-trafficking, so that trafficking is unprofitable, risky, high cost, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, an emergency release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Trafficking Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created for the establishment of an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that the App is called "Reunion", I feel warm.
The new technology means not only the name "literature and art", full of feelings, but also the application of information technology is appropriate, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim before the case of abduction and trafficking is solved.
Prioritizing matters, such as whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be subject to the death penalty or not, can be put aside for careful discussion under the urgent purpose of "seeking help "; however, the matter of rescuing abducted children cannot be discussed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers tend to stay away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after they are successful.
An extra minute of delay in the search for abductions may make the child one step further away from the parents and make the case more difficult to solve.
In this context, it is indeed practical to come up with effective methods such as the "Reunion" platform that will directly help solve cases and find children.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a major task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
The fight against crime and the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of law, all need to carry out the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a railway station, and the parents are asleep, only to wake up to find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he or she should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns of rest between parents or placing the child under safe protection are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against the crime of abduction and trafficking, the side that buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the legal penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years; in particularly serious cases, the death penalty can be imposed and property confiscated.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, and under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a crime with a heavier penalty.
But there are still a lot of cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in their concept of raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up simultaneously.
In order to effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, strict law enforcement by the authorities alone cannot be relied on.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, and the traffickers are motivated by profit, constantly innovate the means of trafficking, and form a "law-fighting" situation with the law-enforcers, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, the elimination of backward concepts and the popularization of common sense in the law will also help to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and purchase of children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the 6th Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress at Malan Mountain
Drawing Endeavour from the 100-year history of the Party
According to the unified arrangement of the provincial Party committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial Party committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the provincial Party committee, made an interactive speech at Malan Mountain Video Culture Park, in-depth study and implementation of the spirit of the 6th Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, study and implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech to Hunan important instructions and instructions, study and implementation of the spirit of the 12th Party Congress.

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, in five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by removing foreign matter through mechanical cold pressing and filtration directly from fresh olive fruit.
Depending on the acidity, there are three levels:
Extra Virgin: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, with a pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Moderate in taste and flavor, with no more than 3.3% acidity.
Refined olive oil refers to the refined olive oil obtained from virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a clear pale golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil or Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil is extracted from the oil residue by dissolution and refined.
If you have looked at the rating classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is just like the grapes that make wine, and olive fruit from different producing areas and different olive fruit varieties produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of oil olives, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in fertile areas.
Main production areas Origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and other countries have similar climates as far south as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
Harvest month for oil olives:
From March to June of each year, it is the time for the olive tree to blossom and set fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the time to pick the fruit (the freshness of olive oil is important).
Benefits of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic and linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
Biden says freedom never goes out as democracy summit ends
The online "Summit for Democracy" convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said he planned to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Guanchong, currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the job ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the small fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said defending democracy requires the concerted efforts of society as a whole.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffer and shock forces of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.", he said
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the themes were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Guanchong addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Uyghur and Tibetan minorities.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We have to use all [resources] we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Law also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
During a round-table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, a member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a "National Statement" via video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against despotism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting COVID-19 through transparency and building trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we don't have to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to remove the shelf to defeat disinformation. "
As the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was scheduled, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights abuses, and investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights abuses.

Hello, the drooling chicken from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to practice at a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap beat, such "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in strength, the ball hits the top of the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not withstand, it is difficult for a master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is, tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, you know you don't want to buy expensive, get a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so that the beat is cheap, you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you have improved, then come to me to buy expensive, I earn twice.
Suggest to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand racket a little better, choose the principle, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can not sell the price, the new shoot 500, 600 is good, the second-hand 200 yuan, with a thousand yuan to enjoy?
Very friendly to newbies, but after the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not go through the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times
May I help you follow up?
Postponed
Thank you
So, actually, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Will the original order be ignored?
Hello, I ordered the food from this restaurant, but a lot of the food was missing, and the drooling chicken was raw

What's the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was a "quick look! Project managers can hit the gold medal of the Olympic project" article very hot, it was mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be the first, no one can match: moving bricks, travel, stay up late is the daily life of the project manager, fire fighting, backpacking, apologizing is not to mention.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also tells the daily poignancy of project managers, which represents the incompetence of the current project management work.
And the personnel engaged in project management work, also gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma at work.
Judging by the annual increase in the number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600 thousand, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid licenses was about 300 thousand, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of global PMP® licenses.
The number of PMP holders has increased year by year over the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers are aware that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and that the rapidly changing work environment lets us know that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that the project management work unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, you can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but the real project management work is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, rely solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, can not be landed in the work, project estimates are not allowed, the sensitivity of the control is poor, the project dragged on and on; members of the division of labor is not clear, the "old" in the team do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R & D management for more than 10 years, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R & D talent, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R & D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, with the "R & D Project Manager Training Camp" online course.

The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation, although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the label of "excessive profligacy", but some young people do have excessive consumption and consumption behavior, and thus have excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even lead to a gradual increase in social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively respond to the call of regulation, with practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.
Over the past years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and imperceptibly guided the consumption needs of young people in various forms, such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, to help them establish rational consumption concepts, rational planning of consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the arrival of double 12, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumer awareness and the correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption and borrowing errors, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned in advance, according to the ability and on time repayment.
If it is overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car and buying a home.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more responsive and diversified services, continue to help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption, moderate borrowing, and become a lifelong reliable consumer finance partner.

Vietnam People's Daily-Gulf Cooperation Council meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, it was Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal cohesion of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes leading to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by both countries in Qatar.
The resolution of differences among the Gulf Arab countries in order to restore relations with Qatar stems from the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and is aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab states for believing it would not resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a "competitor" and as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop of nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran that failed to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first among GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

The car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's successor-the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly MYR 2 million, a year's road tax of MYR 10 thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That counts the small series also do not know, the data say 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably is the small series of myvi only to 30km/h when they reach 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly illustrate the style of the Lamborghini.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, Google yourself, small make up a number of Google does not necessarily give the explanation!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, it is not comfortable! (Actually a bit cool)
1km oil money is around RM1 (owners do not care at all)
Practice the position of getting on and off, or it will be a little awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you'll be deaf when you get off the bus. (But it's still cool)
The body is too big, it will be very narrow in the ordinary parking space, and it is afraid to be knocked on when the car next door opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian himself said, has nothing to do with the owner, haha)

Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times in the same frequency resonance - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to the long-term accumulation of a university in the development process of a series of school-running ideas and value pursuit, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our university, it arose in the autumn of national distress, and its spirit is deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde and save the world, cultivate Qi and rule peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "developing a powerful country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying on a global scale. As an important "supply side" of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the "overall plan to promote the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines" put forward, while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move from a major country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also put forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class ranks in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, so as to achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of latecomer, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to gather strength, shape the brand, enhance the image; third, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen the goal-driven, gather consensus, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catch up with the advanced level of the world.
In particular, we should realize that building a world-class university cannot be one-size-fits-all, and that each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target orientation, running a school tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running the school: first, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and school-enterprise integration, and form a chain-wide entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and iconic cross-achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times with the same frequency resonance.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Virtue, Differentiation, and Truthfulness", as well as "Heiner River, Kai Zhen and High Virtue, Opening Things to the People, and Building Our Nation" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for our use", and is reflected in the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools; "Kai Zhen thick virtue" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and perfection, refers to the university in the pursuit of truth at the same time, but also to receive the edification of virtue and personality; "open things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including both knowledge innovation, scientific research innovation, but also performance of reform and development, reform and innovation; "tree my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, and says that the university should always be proud and humiliated with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The deaf hear in silence, and the bright see in the unformed".
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, the national spirit of mutual agitation, so as to achieve national prosperity and rejuvenation, the realization of the common ideal of mankind to provide an inexhaustible impetus.

As NFTs rush out of the loop, a new concept has sprung up in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn a steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-building game based on blockchain technology that combines a variety of gameplay including NFTs, and is currently the highest-traded NFT project, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, directly ahead of "King's Glory".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said it had more than 1 million daily active users.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, but can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to enjoying and earning financial benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
See a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, refers to the choice of investment target industries, first of all to choose industries with large growth space, at least more than 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose industries with good future growth, consider in the next 3-5 years after the industry growth to achieve the best state of the industry; finally, to choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Come on for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to sum up 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which is to do things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current field continues to deepen or extend the horizontal field (strategic thinking) ; on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking) ; on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can think about how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
In its 12 years of existence, Bitcoin has ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American state of El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender, the first time bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions at 3 Ivy League schools, including Yale - Xinhuanet
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) --More than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice on Wednesday to protest against discrimination against Asian-American applicants at three Ivy League schools--Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to prestigious U.S. schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants among the three prestigious U.S. schools has remained at the same level, Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference.
Many studies have shown that these universities "consistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive" admissions process.
Zhao said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate of any ethnic group relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice to investigate the complaint and take measures to stop the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in their admissions if they found the facts.
They also expect the universities complained of to take the initiative to pay attention to the issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani descent in the United States also participated in the complaint.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house Lin, on the same day through a bank transfer remittance of 20 million yuan as a deposit.
Lin in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the payee signed, which states, "if the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the plant within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the payment method, leading to the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 20 million yuan to Mr. Lu.
It is difficult to fancy the house, the deposit paid, the house is ready, on the "one foot at the door" to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell, which let Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the final failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed to be unable to negotiate, so the penalty of the deposit should not be applied in the case, and the defendant did not have to bear the responsibility for breach of contract by returning the deposit twice.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
The lawyer cautioned that the necessary duty of care should be exercised in the course of the transaction.
When signing the contract, as the buyer to do the necessary duty of care, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and in the contract clearly about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" concluded on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw lines with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
According to the Chinese government, "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out'democratic transformation ', imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated a'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long become a'weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit was Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy problems, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been international and domestic skepticism, such as criticism of the inclusion of authoritarian leaders, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and doubts that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Just-in-office German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
"Today's American democracy is full of pathologies, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party rivalries, political polarization, social rifts, ethnic conflicts, and the polarization between rich and poor intensifying," China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday, saying that American democracy is a "game of the rich" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffer and shock forces of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We have to constantly renew it in every generation, and in my opinion, it is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges".
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year campaign after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of us deliver on our commitments and report on our progress next year".

Educational Reflections: How University Examinations Make "Academic Bullies" and "Academic Dregs" Work in Their Place - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university leadership, reflecting their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, so that the examination truly reflects the actual level of students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of learning, the learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test question type is single, the repetition rate is high, the question is too simple, will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the assault, if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "learning slag" usually do not invest can pass, or even get a high score; "learning bully" usually never fall out of class, homework, notes are good, the examination is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, Lanzhou Jiaotong University students reflect the problems in the university examination is not for nothing, I believe that this situation is not only Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to university are aware that it is not uncommon to prepare for the test, think of various ways to "take" the test questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the test, and get "key guidance" before the test, even in the test with a small copy, after the test for the teacher's high hand is not a strange story.
In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guidance, to measure whether a university examination is qualified or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and on the scientific proposition on this basis.
At the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many major courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject, is the content of the university examination to examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense, from the point of knowledge, the space for change is not big, basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "20 years ago, I studied the basics of college mathematics, but I'm still learning it, and I'm still focusing on it."
But the knowledge point is basically the same, does not mean that the test question type is single, the test question is repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually composed of a question group, and then the senior teacher of the subject co-ordinates the composition of the examination paper, and the examination review is also attended by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so as to overcome the duplication of the examination questions to a certain extent.
But to draw up a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions according to the overall situation of students' learning, difficult and normal distribution, but also need to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation, a comprehensive analysis of the degree of students' learning, so that the test proposition on the difficult and dynamic grasp of the question type, not only can highlight the basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability to test, and innovative design of the question type.
Examination is the baton of university education, what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding test preparation program, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the student's letter of recommendation, and has deployed a rectification plan in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of the final examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine the assessment of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of single type of test questions, repeated questions and so on is the issue that the university examination affairs need to face, of course, need to introduce the corresponding system, but the effort is expensive in the daily, need teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, both sides to understand, teaching and learning will be better docking, form a benign interaction, the examination will be more in line with reality, so that the "student bully" and "student slag" in their respective places.
If I can't change the location of the branch for me, can I change it to delivery?
So I don't have to give more money, huh?
My colleague's order has been delivered
It's too late to finish
What about the GPS?
Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (South Street Store) There is no branch yet
Before taking the photo because we did not schedule, changed the time twice, consultant Lan Lan was very patient to help us arrange the time.
Then I chose a good weather weekend to shoot.
Mrs King's staff, whether consultants, make-up artists or photographers, were excellent.
It was the first time in my life that I officially made up, and wow, I couldn't believe that I would be that good looking one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and another sister (sorry I can't remember the name) make-up is super patient, and make-up is natural.
The exterior scene was taken in Jiangwan City, fortunately the weather was good, and it didn't feel very cold. When taking the photo, the make-up artist kept an eye on our clothes and headgear from time to time, and immediately helped us sort it out when it was a little bit bad.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy at the end of the day.
When selecting photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected photos, really, didn't let us add photos, 24 of the direct package, none of them added (I heard that my cousin, who was taking wedding photos about the same time, had more than 10,000 photos added to the package of more than 7,000, then I was stunned, and I was afraid that I would choose too many)
Today the photo was fixed, Lan Lan sent me, I looked at two of them and thought it was not good, and they immediately helped me repair it.
Turning out the photos my sister took before and comparing them, I think I'm really satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go and take a wedding photo with Mrs. Xuan Hanjin!
Set price: 3,999 yuan
Mrs. King is grateful to have you sincerely wish you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock because of special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said it had been unable to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper had run out, and so far 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the director of the bureau, Kailu Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth papers were recorded in the system and would be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrived next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-long report by an online media outlet about the problem of raw paper printing in Sabah.
He said that the problem arose two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, leading to delays in their arrival in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah for raw paper is different from that used in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
According to Kerouaminus, the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to collect the goods, return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, estimated to be two more working days (December 20) can be delivered to the applicant."
"We will inform applicants to go to all branches to collect the paper."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.

Hours negative nucleic acid, set up "buffer zone" State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a letter to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening COVID-19 prevention and control work in port cities, requiring the recent departure of land border port cities (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) personnel need to hold a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and go to land border port cities after the arrival of at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date on which the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of the port city and announce it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of regional differentiated management policy, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the threshold forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, with the minimum social impact, the lowest social cost to achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The notice pointed out that this exposed some local epidemic monitoring and early warning is not timely, high-risk post personnel closed-loop management is not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing is a formality, cold chain items in all aspects of elimination and killing is not in place, centralized isolation site management is not standardized, epidemic emergency response is not scientific and accurate and other issues.
The notice requires efforts to improve the port city epidemic prevention and control mechanism, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, the implementation of border control measures and other nine aspects, speed up the completion of port city prevention and control weaknesses, do a good job in prevention and control work without relaxation, science and precision, and weave dense and firm external defense input lines.
The notice stressed that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood protection work, publish and smooth people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the supply of basic living materials, prices and other aspects of the emerging hidden dangers, timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in the notice include the counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the Central Government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

The truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: Pipeline)
On December 11, a microdocumentary on the pipeline platform called "The Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism" launched the war in Afghanistan, through the war to forcibly export American democracy, 20 years of militarism, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committed all kinds of crimes against humanity.
The indiscriminate use of drones in air strikes on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and sets up killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity have provoked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is "more anti-terrorist".
The war did not bring hope for peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Unintentionally see the following article, from a commercial point of view and the perspective of the shelf life of why the customer to the logistics company in the bonded area to help do the canned goods, although the canned goods are deep processing, not the scope of the bonded logistics company's business, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in the bag and listen to them are the same, there is no difference.
So you are sure to ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of hearing bags is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so large?
In fact, from this point a lot of consumers, or mom-level think that this is because the raw materials are not the same so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mentality to eat after the reaction also said that listen to the taste or taste is not the same!
Now let me say to you first listen to the reason that the installation is expensive, where is it expensive?
Why is the difference so large when they have the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers at the time of pricing take into account that if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits produced by manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit, then what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening devices to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly push is a listening device, rather than a bag.
And you think that so many manufacturers every year advertising costs tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, how does this cost?
You can imagine that.
So with the development of society, the marketing costs, such as: marketing personnel in shopping malls, display costs in shopping malls, product giveaways, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
So each manufacturer is also constantly increasing new products, and is listening to the assembly, its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs of new products.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of not more than 3, 4 yuan.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their products, regardless of means, linked to the hospital doctors, who assist in the promotion of the product, from a hearing inside the profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate such methods, in fact, this practice is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy a bag of milk powder into a can on the premise of having a can at home, so that you can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, there is no impact on children.
There are also people do not think that the shelf life of the listening bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the listening bag and the bag is the same after the opening of the bag, just that the bag is not easy to save after the opening of the bag, easy to be affected by moisture deterioration.

Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful learning books.
Many of today's success books promote the "best principle"-that is, assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that all of a sudden across the "how to do", in fact, the most important and fundamental link.
For this reason, these books all have one thing in common--either do it at its best, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle," anyone who looks at it will admit that it is "absolutely right," but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation," which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conformist, conformist, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in their ears, which is no doubt self-deception, playing the piano to the bull.
The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "change" cowardly, hesitant, difficult to resolve; or with a temporary impulse pain under the "change" determination, and brave to take the first step, but often short-lived, can not persist for a while to lose the battle, it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk of "From Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the capacity of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is one way to put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold"-it encourages a "small win for a big win" theory, that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dune on your doorstep, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold is greatly reduced, so there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It is only a little longer to follow the "second-best principle" of success.
All in all, the "best principle", while ostensibly designed to make everyone successful, ultimately inspires a small number of people, while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserves this year increased by 0.71 million tons over the previous year, to 108,500 tons, compared with the initial protection in 2002, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangshui fish", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and killing, and the degradation of the environment in the waters where naked carp breed. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species on the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers into Qinghai Lake, the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continue to increase protection efforts, Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserves increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake has accumulated nearly 180 million tails of artificial proliferation and release, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the spread of desertification in the west and east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued a ban on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant will only get me a bag, and it will be cold to put it in
Would you like to ask, is the takeaway in a bag?
We only saw one bag
I want to know if it was leaked, or if some of us took it, thanks
It's been an hour, and it hasn't arrived yet
I just saw an article that was written as a fake, which is too long.
Give science to men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first official holiday on a day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, the premise of good health will be more regular once a month.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck can turn over (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people three days, some people a week; some people are few, and some people have blood slides; some people have no response, and some people have pain until the ambulance takes them away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, and the previous pain does not mean a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation can not be controlled, start to end a few days to the end of the 24-hour bleeding, can do only with a sanitary towel or tampon blood to prevent the flow of clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly because of the secretion of prostaglandins, physiological period just before the beginning of the menstrual period to eat ibuprofen can be effective in alleviating the pain of the month, after the onset of dysmenorrhea to eat no use.
Before the physiological period because of uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, easy to loose stomach.
If it is about the cycle, somehow loose stomach, basically within two days will come menstruation.
Sanitary towels are best replaced two or three hours, or easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add a prepared portion may have 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modified here, tampons do not have to be changed often, about five or six hours can be changed, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation can also be because of hormonal changes in the body emotional instability, is very unfortunate, the body to make a trip to themselves.
But official crime rate data show that women's ability to control their emotions is still high, and they don't use emotional issues as an excuse.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding of the endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month a house is built (the endometrium thickens) ready to meet the guests, the guests do not come, all tear down (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, consecutive decades, a few days a month 24 hours of blood, but also abdominal pain and low back pain, who would like?
But a person can be born because his mother comes to menstruate, menstruation is to prepare for the first time you come to this world to live in a 10-month house, everyone should thank their mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, a lot of women's things were suppressed, and society said it was dirty and shameful to brainwash women, and everyone thought it was that, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the female body's preparation for life is disgusting, should not be said in public, the girls stand up, do not think so again, have never experienced, this life will not experience, and do not know much about the men, do not be so ungrateful at any rate, this attitude how good to face their mother, how good to want their own children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which are really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival, the wrong delivery is more disappointing
Want to order another meal for the children
I hope that the store will check the production in its busy schedule
Is the foot soaking in the foot bath a leak of electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care, and today Gome Xiaobian will make an answer to this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bath is becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of different grades of products have emerged on the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan of foot bath, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, health-care appliances such as foot baths are selling hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numb when he soaked his feet.
At first Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot tub, but did not expect to turn off the vibration function, and his father still felt the soles of his feet numb.
Mr. Li tried the pen, and it turned on, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the business, the attitude of the business is good, although the foot bath returned, Mr. Li is still unhappy.
Because he found that the long-popular foot tub now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what kind of materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
But in general, the foot bath is not charged, but it does not rule out that a small number of products are not strictly controlled at the factory.
So choose a split foot bath at the time of purchase.
Water and electricity are separated, without any safety risks.
At the same time, you can take the pen at will.

Metaphysics refers to the study, through rational reasoning and logic, of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the way of the metaphysical person, and the device of the metaphysical person" in the I Ching and the Trilogy Upload, which was translated by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era) from the metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extended problems.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent the real entity of existence, and which nouns simply represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
It is based on the belief that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural causes, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the study of God without a word.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Theory of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the norms of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into metaethics (the study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism in the abstract), and normative ethics (the evaluation of different moral views, and the recommendation of moral guidelines for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should adhere to), applied ethics (the study of the application of ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (the collection of information about how people live, summarizing it from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not begin with a preconceived theory, but rather investigates the true choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to that choice, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: Humanistic ethics, represented by Vara and Montaigne.
The second part: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part 3: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli et al., modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, represented by Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Huxley et al., 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Li Kai et al., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green et al.), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche et al.).
Logic is the study of "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retrospective reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have received over the long period of more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
The vast majority of the old parents of the victims are now dead, and the orphans have grown up and started a family and employment.
It was your righteous act that helped us distressed families through the most difficult of times.
At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop making humanitarian contributions to the Tiananmen Mothers Group, which is long overdue for a perfect end.
I will always remember your love, and I firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance between the National Federation of Learning (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the National Learning Federation and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often cross.

Relief money is often not delivered smoothly to June 4 difficult hands.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by "Tiananmen Mothers" to co-ordinate and be in charge of the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4 Orphan Education Fund", 11 years after its implementation, in 2009, after all of the June 4 orphans graduated from university, the MCDF then established the "June 4 Solitary Elderly Special Difficult Households Relief Fund", and has been implemented so far.
The funding for these projects comes mainly from campus and social donations in the year of June 4, from the generosity of individuals, and is supported by the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Reform-through-Labour Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, for the first time in 31 years, that the June 4 disaster victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June 4.
During this period, China Human Rights has also been independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of the June 4 donation is for the sake of donors, and we are indeed all retirees, whose income is not as abundant as it was before retirement, and I would like to express my thanks to Mr. Ding's "To Friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of those in difficulty to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
I would also like to express my gratitude and respect to those brave and courageous colleagues who have persisted in their generosity and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you very much for choosing our products, before you use our chip, please take 5 minutes to carefully read the following:
After opening the box, please check whether the goods are complete.
If there is a shortage, please contact customer service in a timely manner.
The cover plate of the microfluidic chip is PC material, do not pass in the solvent that has chemical reaction with PC.
Do not use a hand-pushed syringe to directly inject the chip, otherwise it is prone to leakage.
Microfluidic chips for ordinary substrates pass pure water testing at either 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) injection pressure before shipment.
Glass-based chips all pass the pure water test at 800mbar (100um channel) filling pressure before shipment, so you should be careful not to collide with sharp objects during the use of glass-based chips, which will damage the substrate.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Under the condition that the injection pump is filled with pure water, we give you a recommended flow rate of 150ul/min or less, and an oil-phase flow rate of 50ul/min or less.
Depending on the viscosity of the actual filling liquid, increase your flow rate parameter from slow to fast.
After the experiment is completed, please clean the internal channel in a timely manner, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumable and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be returned or replaced.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand greater pressure or flow rate, you can contact customer service to customize.

Thank you Rabbit for the review originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style did not think that the finished product is simply beautiful
Thank you for the approval of Dan, your satisfaction can make us full of electricity to continue to move forward, we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great and highly recommended to all the small friends!
Everything from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to the post-production is impeccable.
Makeup artists are particularly delicate, will match your style to suit your makeup, cosmetics are also used in the first line of big brands.
Not to mention teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite a major.
The whole studio is artistic, and there are two kittens playing with it.
We work in Beijing, and all the better studios in Beijing need to queue up half a year in advance, and my colleagues have filmed it in Beijing, and I think it's just so so.
Desperately looking for this studio, a place with a soul and an attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, I think that this is also a short version of most people, photographer Liang brother will capture, record natural wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-design, a sophisticated team.
Out into the film we and the people around us all praise.
I have recommended my best friend in the past, and she has just seen the film and is also full of joy.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and that more people will find ta and shoot it in their own style, rather than in the same way.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling, both are very thoughtful and creative new people, we are a creative studio, as long as customers like us to do 100% of the effort to complete, grateful to meet
Sweet and caring assistant, and lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone on the team was super nice A wonderful shoot, a very memorable experience, and the effect of the shoot was much better than I thought A lot of people have worked hard, so thank you for your comments😘😘
Thank you for your review It's also a fate to know you From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao The trust in us is thousands of kilometers away So many I'm happy to know you have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time
How do I give the money?

Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A little programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to self-study, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it will take six months to learn.
But if you are planning to get into this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are extremely weak in self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have a strong self-control, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to look at the teacher strength of this institution, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong teacher strength.
Secondly, before choosing to explore the training institution, it is best to explore the students out of the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution in the end, the course taught is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer the question you asked, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your major, age, language you want to learn, or even which city you are in, it all depends on the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now a lot of online offline training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, two investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if I said these cases, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b station also has a lot of training resources, if you will not look for resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed advice is also OK.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that the study does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also special questions to answer, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal push places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the post-job interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, because I do not know your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said it was before 1 o'clock, and I saw it all on the app

China and Saudi Arabia Curators Jointly Hold Saudi Arabia's First Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale--Diriya Biennale of Contemporary Art--was officially opened to the public on November 11 in the Diriya JAX Art District, located in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriye Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Fei-yu, curator of UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
Covering an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the Biennale spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River with a Stone", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of works on display, including paintings, installation art, and performing arts. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention, with some artists using recycled materials in novel ways, such as Xu Bing's reconstruction of a classic landscape painting from waste in "The Story Behind the Scenes" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Diriye Biennale Foundation, expressed his hope that the Biennale would establish international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and enhance interaction.
Tian Fei-yu said, "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the Biennale, during which artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize rural public welfare post management - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) in order to continue to do a good job in poverty alleviation employment assistance, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization of rural public welfare post management, to help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
According to the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts for the employment of poverty-stricken labor and other rural disadvantaged groups, playing an important role in helping poverty-stricken people to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively enhance the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations by the Yunnan People's Society, rural revitalization, finance and other seven departments jointly issued, mainly on the grass-roots recruitment of rural public welfare posts of the target range, fund management, post development, post management and other aspects of unified norms.
In terms of post development and setting, the new rules are clear, in accordance with the principles of "on-demand post establishment, post determination, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, public announcement, recruitment, pre-job training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare posts should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for those placed in rural public welfare posts, and require relevant departments to monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts on a regular basis.

2. Although the Rightists have an era of ambition in history, it is not long, so it is short because a little sun shines, and a little boiling water sweats; a little ambition leads to prosperity, and when attacked, it will be short-lived.
But to be realistic, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
In terms of ending the Cultural Revolution's definition of truth standards, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li-dong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li-dong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
But I am opposed to his anti-communist theory, I believe that anti-necessary revolution, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihood is damaged, political groups are mixed in the mud, and then foreign countries take advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, we need to be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to be emboldened by political speculation are not the right, they are assholes.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of anachronistic and political outcasts.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when it needs to, then the left is not created, because what the left wants is the dregs the Communist Party has thrown away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends fighting against thieves while contradicting their left foot, and still quite angry, so I don't think it is necessary.
Do not try to reason with a traitor or a left epilepsy, they are all a sinew, unreasonable to talk about.
And don't try to prove we're right, let alone let the anti-thief and the left-hander admit, why?
I tell my friends this: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, and when the left-hander scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get older, they forget them, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually away, and even kill a dragon at the end of the year become a evil dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture lead to China as a whole should be left-leaning.
On the other hand, the domestic right is liberal and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens regulation and focuses more on equity and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, it's all right to like it
I don't say anything about it, but flowers are just that
Over the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the United States Emperor has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States imperialist crackdown on China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries related enterprises at the same time to blockade China's chip industry, a direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing chip manufacturers to reduce investment in research and development, production capacity decline, resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chain disorder.
Now the "lack of core" has affected the world's major industries, such as car companies to stop production, mobile phone prices, almost all industries that use chips are suffering.
In order to master the autonomy of the "chip", technology giants in more and more countries are beginning to go on the path of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently made frequent moves, and is hosting the "chip summit "; it is also inviting the 64-country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and draw funds to support the domestic technology giants of the United States, for example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, a veteran technology giant of the United States, spent $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and open up the chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for this certainty is that, as an old technology giant of the United States, Intel has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent and technical reserves, and will be able to rapidly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou is dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made an amazing speech, for Intel to spend money to build a wafer factory this move, Zhang Zhongmou has no scruple to say: Intel built a chip foundry, quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's foray into the field of wafers is because Zhang Zhongmou is still upset about a feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies of the last century, Intel has been the pearl of the United States' manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world, and is the world's dominant semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been mastered by a small number of powerful.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, some small businesses are overwhelmed by this model, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only afford to stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
Motivated by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear division of labor and cooperation phenomenon, in 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there are companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there are companies specializing in design, then you can set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC has focused its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", and does not carry out design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was a little help in front of the Big Mac, Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had looked for Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was clear that some self-esteem was very high, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also concluded that Intel was looking down on wafer processing services at the time.
Did not expect that the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then, but now also want to start doing wafer foundry.
So, Zhang Zhongmou thought it was ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry.
TSMC's market value now exceeds that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel is naturally not afraid to stand still.
Today, TSMC has made a sprint toward a 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm, where it was seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Don't wait

Take a look at some "strange hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Random selection of three hot searches: February Erlong rise, Hollyoaks price increases, and goods Lara event, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the "index decline" (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if secondary public opinion will have a small hump again.
They seem to be no different from the "evolving model of online public opinion" once displayed on the CAC's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six heat searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing "solitary peaks", "jagged", and "cliff-like".
"Solitary peak" that is artificial heating, quickly hit the list of hot search, causing public concern; "jagged" that is periodic heating, to ensure that the topic of hot search list; "cliff-like" that is collective withdrawal, the hot search play a "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another, and the time is not different, so it must be the unified water forces that have been tasked to start a new offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which blackmail decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes to refine the battle, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread and spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, put aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every walk will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

Daimei 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12/F, Happiness Home, 156 South Huancheng Road
At first it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the beginning of my budget is 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
When I came to the store, I started a series of deception.
I was at the store for the first time only to show them my apartment map, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they actually can give me a quote saying that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably showed me their materials and did not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you arrive at the store you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is handed in you will never be back, unless you have enough experience to fight them in theory).
When I'm hesitant to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of being cheated alive, and when my mind is impulsive, I made a deposit of more than ten thousand.
The offer he gave me had a lot of problems 7 million not including water and electricity renovation, not including any doors and cupboards for bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the base installation.
Excluding these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in the company, and at the beginning I signed the contract without saying anything clearly.
When I went to ask them for a refund they were very experienced and had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
It's the customer's problem they're not responsible for at all.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, there are a lot of details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friends look for them to decorate the house is also bad quality, late to calculate all kinds of costs for you.
Pit father, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, now changed into a big beauty, as if they have gone out of business and changed into other.
So don't choose such a pit daddy decoration company.
After everyone in the choice of more than Baidu to look at these check these consultations because the decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a business question, please log in or register
It is strictly forbidden to publish all forms of business reviews, please see the merchant inclusion statement for details
Kunming decoration design channel to provide you with the latest business information such as Daimei 360 integrated home improvement address, telephone, operating hours, and so on, look for decoration company decoration company, on the public review
So horrible, if it doesn't arrive in 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way, for example, to change an address?
Okay, then you don't cancel the conversation, and if you don't refund me in 5 to 10 days, you must pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes
The drooling chicken should be cooked, but what it receives is raw meat, and there is no way to eat it
The Gemini meteor shower will be a great one on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Runjian) astronomical science experts, as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great December 14, like meteor shower friends can be observed in the middle of the night.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent object of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent object of the Gemini meteor shower is the asteroid Phaethon 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor body is slow, rich in color, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Thistle, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be at its peak on December 14 at around 15:00, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the'falling 'Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight and will be a bit less exciting.
The 14th is November 11 of the lunar calendar, the moon phase is full and convex, and the bright moon will interfere with the observation, but the moon will set in the middle of the night, when the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher.
If you like meteor showers, you can observe them in the middle of the night, hours after the end of the month, but be careful to keep warm. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside, you can choose a place with a high altitude, low light damage, and an open view facing the northeast, and then patiently wait until the moon sets for visual observation.
It is important to note that the Geminid meteor shower flows in all directions, so you don't have to keep an eye on the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous'meteor shower blockbuster ', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, shooting with a high ISO and maximum aperture.
Tripod, spare battery and shutter cable are also essential for stability and continuity. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the title of the traditional TV should refer to LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning of the difference, there are the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared to the full spread of LCD TV market positioning, laser TV is clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meet the needs of users for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to China Yikang's forecast, in 2020, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high growth.
The reason for having such a good result in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eye, compared to the back light source of LCD TV light, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Saisi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, came to 144 sets of test data.
Data confirmed: laser TV does have a strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast with LCD TV prices continue to decline, the current market price of laser TV is mostly in the tens of thousands of yuan, with the size and light source upgrade, the price gradually climbed.
Why does laser TV sell so expensive?
It must have made sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TV has a lot of advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV projection distance is shorter than traditional projection equipment, can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the space required is small, and the host is small, take up a small space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus, the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, and so on, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
There is no pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video players, want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try, everything has pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment, afraid of listening to one-sided words.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV-has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block part of the ambient light, the use of a micro-structure Fresnel screen, expensive, 80-inch price can basically be replaced by a 65-inch liquid crystal.
Another point, I particularly hate projection manufacturers take diffuse reflection for the eyes good as a selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, must be real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it can not be like.
It's just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a lot of light is reflected into the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Photographic Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store does not have a branch yet
Add the WeChat appointment date, the little sister sent me the optional schedule, reply to the information in a timely manner~
Before going to see the shooting works in the store, more outdoor wedding dress, shoot very beautiful, involved in a lot of shooting style.
When the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my ideas with my little sister, and very patiently helped me try two sets of my tangled style clothes, and finally decided to start makeup modeling-the photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and improve on every detail.
But maybe because I didn't exchange specific shooting ideas with me, it wasn't the style I wanted to shoot, but it should be a good-looking experience🙊
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help select the photos, exchange late style, feel very careful.
It will take about half a month to fix the piece, and wait for the effect~
For the second time in the photography category, most of the clothes in the audience were able to choose one shot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze dress and experienced a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, make-up + shooting, the photographer in charge of the shooting is the brother of the post-95, it feels a little bit green, I hope that in the future can give more advice in the direction of the customer shooting action It is quite talkative, the shooting process is more pleasant.

On the home page, also take a look at Queenie

The "environment" as a whole is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three make-up places, and inside is a studio.
The service was warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very careful to teach you the movements.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make a retake.
The "experience" may be a little over the shape, and the original double eyelids were posted with three eyelids.
The eyebrow tail was also shaved, a little awkward for everyday not to draw eyebrows.
Photo ten days to give, but the P-picture effect is not satisfied, feel the double eyelid paste those are still very obvious.

The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
I now have to pay the freight every time
Can you waive it first, and then charge my monthly fee after you have completed your investigation?
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, reliable?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of the establishment conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Regulation of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015) " tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan before it can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are in fact very demanding, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the national authority of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervision of insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders should have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are three thresholds, not what insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, a lot of companies star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest hit and Thai Super Mary 5 serious illness insurance, claims and insurers are and Thai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: the products of the Internet platform, because there is less operating costs of business outlets, and the cost of salesman wages, so the Internet products generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the payment pressure of the policyholder, at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professional requirements of the industry, a lot of Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of errors, in the health information and occupation of this, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their subjective awareness, feel their health or in line with, so there are a lot of claims hidden dangers, there may be a risk of rejection.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro-Insurance" (which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform, like Little Umbrella), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true, but also reliable, not reliable is the people, the Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are a lot of sales misinformation.
For example: 1 yuan insurance to cover 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 6 million serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the heavy lifting, will not tell the policyholder, 1 yuan in the first month, the next month is required to be charged according to the normal, dozens to 200, many customers deduct a fee for a year or two to buy their own is not clear.
Thinking it could cost one dollar, the insurance company paid six million (the world's pie).
Free mobile phone, is the end of the policy number such as 6666, 8888 this special policy number paragraph only to send, and if the winning text message is issued, they do not exchange, and no one reminds.
(This is another pit for the policyholder) Free 60000 serious illness insurance, is a short-term, if you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60000 can do it, can not solve the problem, later life begins to run naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misinformation about Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, the problem is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesman.
Suggested topic master comprehensive careful consideration, in fact, a lot of offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are also better than the cost-effective Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, and saving 2,000-3,000 yuan/year in premiums per person.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, has three years of enterprise management training experience, has served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from customer needs, customized insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers to shop around, try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy sorting, policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Life-long growth with each customer.
I hope that my answer can be helpful to the question owner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance adviser need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder himself.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "sense of ceremony", or even the printed version of the paper contract is not, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model, a bit like "telemarketing" general assembly line operations, but so buying insurance can also have a fatal problem, and that is, follow, up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we have chosen is an "insurance intermediary" who can stay with us for a long time and will provide us with services many years from now?

From the past to the present, I am opposed to all forms of slander and abuse, and even less can I accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we want to put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that you should resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, to making teasing posts, to your attempts to post the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive approach.
You later intensified your efforts not only to tag me on the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to brazenly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some vague, humiliating comments about me, look, body, how to have a baby, what kind of bed to grow strawberries, whether to plug, and so on, and I, too.
Then I got a number of friends who sent me a picture of you and sexual harassment comments about your Facebook friend account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer continue to be silent.
After the news of my alarm was uploaded, you did not converge at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, no matter what status you are, in our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make this kind of teasing, vague, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think that it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your picture or you can continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yeah, I can't, I can't, I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there would be a girl who would be willing to be so humiliated in order to be famous.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's OK after being so bullied.
Whether at work, in society, in politics, or in business, only those who do not even have basic moral qualities will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in people's hearts.
I cut some of the messages for you to comment on
No one can pretend to be you if you post it yourself
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization
A smile on your face
Prime Minister Pham Minh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major meetings were held, focusing on digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises, and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 epidemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Meng Xiong said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number and operating income of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam continued to grow by nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated to focus on solving the major challenges facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Meng Xiong called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for the development of national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to assume the national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations, and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies shared breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promote national digital transformation, and post-epidemic economic recovery.
In his speech at the forum, Prime Minister Pham Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation is the only way for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves all people, so it needs to be mobilized.
People and businesses are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
So all policies need to be for people and businesses.
Prime Minister Pham Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, that internal forces should be the main, strategic, long-term, and decisive factors, and that external forces are important and breakthrough.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 prevention and control, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and contribute to green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participating in the establishment of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, and national customs, and promoting digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and countries increasingly prosperous.
Prime Minister Pham Mingzheng asked governments at all levels, organs at all levels and enterprises to increase leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, improve their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system on digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in the spirit of respect, communication, listening, positive and proactive.

2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese Communist Party media multi-dimensional report: The latest news of China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal is visiting Guam in a rare way, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, the satellite spotted the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait on January 9.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with an F-35C fighter jet and a CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is now cruising the Pacific Ocean.
The Lincoln also carried for the first time an F-35C carrier aircraft squadron, part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan, docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Perception) The U.S. three aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China in a rare visit to Guam, January 17, 2022, on the flight path of the U.S. carrier transport CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Perception) Also, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend, CNN reported on January 17.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base Guam on Saturday (January 15).
A rare visit to Guam by the U.S. three aircraft carriers amassing the most powerful weapons in China's neighborhood said it was a signal to allies and enemies amid growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a United States ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
U.S. three aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China Rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
Pictured is China's Yongxiao Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrates U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on U.S. soil, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose income mainly comes from advertising, and the advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of their functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many Apps external Meta ads, through Meta's advertising platform is realized.
But times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy changes, Meta can no longer get user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow Apps to access their own information, which most people's normal reaction is certainly not.
If Google stabs again next, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's previous income growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
You usually know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that do business in the sea.
Meta has an office in Hong Kong of about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an unbeatable advertising channel, and most of the money burned goes to Meta.
Interestingly, now ByteDance's TikTok is one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years Meta has made a lot of money from bytes.
Various domestic agents are helping ByteDance go to Meta to advertise there, and Meta Greater China's performance is also very good.
I haven't specifically learned about it lately, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TikTok, are out of Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just falling incomes, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not just at income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
It is clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metaverse implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a tough time for Meta.
Despite the fact that Facebook is very popular right now, with $100 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue, in fact, Facebook is very dangerous right now, and there is no good safe moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although several of his social software is now relatively high daily life, but also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on, but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook does not have much confidence, subversion is a blink of an eye.
And the elusive concept of the metaverse has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a no-return road above is some of my thinking, for reference.
