The research results of students singing the protagonist at the Academic annual Meeting of Zhejiang University opened people's minds-Xinhua
Use the air to wash your hands, take a breath to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. Their research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your family medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
“You only need to take a gentle breath, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale.  ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smart phone, and after the gas is exhaled, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new type of material, graphene. Its target is a chemical element. Its keen “sense of smell” allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lamp: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
“Many diseases are not detected early and resection is not in place. It is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.  ”
Shen Junfei said, for example, during the early stage of cancer examination, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has four light panels, which can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of smart surgical lamp has been trialled in Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer at most, while Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of ”air hand washing devices."
As long as we stand on the installed sink, our weight can compress the air out.
“It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean!  ”
Experiments on color rendering reaction and bacterial residues have proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful-first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I find important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time in the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This time is when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window of our lives is only four minutes, four minutes of gold!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls down, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him, rather than standing there stupidly motionless and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
“In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year. The most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be rescued.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70 or 80% can be rescued, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%. ”
This is what Lu Le, the founder of the first reaction, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, his breathing is gone, and his heartbeat is gone, it is useless for you to pinch him.
Artificial breathing and chest compressions must be performed to save people.
I found that few of us still have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross Training center. I registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. There are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals I want to complete before the age of 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw in Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you have to have a first aid certificate to take the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
Among them, there is only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan! ？
Never tried
Why don't you understand #NAME#?
One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# MISSED food delivery, this time just one shrimp dumpling for me to eat! ？
Because obviously I saw it was valid when I entered the code before.
Let's start with the conclusion. I personally think that "Four Seas" is a bad film in all directions, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether this movie has no highlights or not, it's not that at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies. The one that allows you to fall asleep soundly in the cinema is one kind, and the one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching it is also one kind. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Gram novel, indescribable, and the loopholes are like the windbreaker on the little brother.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then she arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a small van.
The elderly are watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van? ？
He and his father are still very relieved about this.
Then the old man didn't follow.
How did the heroine and his brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the speed party punks on the island easily seal a section of mountain road? ？
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck drivers could not be found around.
This sense of props is too obvious.
Why would a punk speed party with bad credit reporting and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't you call the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smart phone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room to sleep overnight?
This kind of inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's even worse is the main thrust of the movie, or that the movie has no main thrust at all, it is an abomination stitch monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you would guess that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you thought it might be a feature film that wanted to reflect the hardships of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't know what you watched at all. What followed was a deep suspicion of yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the movie in the new Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie has succeeded step by step. .
If you want to make a love movie, then you should honestly talk about the grievances and entanglements between the young people in the small town who like to ride motorcycles and the waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot appear contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yin Zheng whose new motorcycle was just burned down and then he could still sing), he couldn't open up some brain holes that he couldn't even bear to see.
As for the heroine, she is obviously not mentally retarded, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
One more thing I can't understand, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen to add a crash plot to his own movie?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival schedule to add congestion to the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction：
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, well wall wall module machinery, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it now has excellent quality, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site：
Check the characteristics and advantages of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures for drainage and water storage facilities, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are all concave-convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the well wall is far better than that of the masonry form of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combination of masonry, the longitudinal holes are interlinked and the transverse holes intersect. After the hole core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcing and waterproof role.
The module is equipped with ribs in both vertical and horizontal directions, and the horizontal and vertical ribs increase the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not easy to collapse, sink, and leak. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-button touch-type LCD display to monitor the entire process of mechanical operation, and realize the ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic and conveying, and double-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of the vibration of the host on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment cloth box, the mold box, the mold release box rises, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically transported, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, seals and hydraulic parts to ensure that the overall performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical excitation platform of the well wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the countertop wire cutting and clamping has no welding points, so that the packing box can swing freely and guide, fully reducing mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the packing is combined with the two-in-one encrypted amplitude, and the integrated, fully synchronous, taiwan vibration and mold vibration are used to ensure that the vibration effect is achieved.
The mechanical excitation machinery and computer automatic control of the well wall module automatically adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance of the raw material, and brake without wear, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control of the well wall wall module.

Chongqing Vocational School pilot modern apprenticeship system admission is a prospective employee of the enterprise-Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, our city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship system” talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training will also have the status of apprentices. After the enrollment is entered, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and engineering procedures for enterprises be standardized, and the dual identities of students in secondary vocational schools and prospective employees of enterprises for apprentices be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and have not reached the age of 18, the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises must sign agreements to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights and interests of apprentices for on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for corporate employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training academic system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In the practice of enterprises, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotating training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each with a number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) have been trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then implementing it, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education of schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of their counterparts.

South African doctor: Although the transmission power of Omik is strong, it is mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the illness caused by the Omicron variant of the new crown virus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, an organization of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have relatively mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough. Flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients have yet needed to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation.  ”
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to fall into severe illness due to Coronavirus infection.
He said that in contrast, in the last wave of the Delta epidemic, the new crown patients he treated “had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases: Among the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% are seriously ill, which is half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent new crown patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak of cases in South Africa, the proportion of deaths reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: “At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease.  ”
He also said: “It's still early days, and we need to obtain late-stage data.
Under normal circumstances, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only entered this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.  ”
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new crown virus strain in the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, of which South Africa is the center of the epidemic.
According to health officials, Gauteng Province saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If it is analogous to the famous public service slogan “There is no killing without buying and selling”, then in a good environment where there is no need for “abduction”, group prevention and group governance, and the whole people's anti-abduction will make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Kidnapping Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion”, I feel full of warmth.
The new technology means are not only full of “literature and art” and full of feelings, but also the proper use of information technology, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many “big words”.
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is resolved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Matters are prioritized. Under the urgent purpose of “seeking rescue”, controversial topics such as “Whether child abduction and trafficking should be subject to the death penalty” can be postponed for a while and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the experience in the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the place of the crime as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction-seeking operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the “reunion” platform that directly helps to solve the case and find the child.
After all, “fighting abduction” is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
Combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of law, all need to implement the care of “protecting young children and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, and their parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find that their children were gone.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking crimes, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of our country's "Criminal Law", the legal starting point for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it may be punishable by death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the general trend of ”light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier penalties.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising their children.
The legal education of these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking in human beings, strict official law enforcement cannot be relied on alone.
If the “market” for abduction collection is widespread, and the traffickers are eager to innovate their methods of abduction and trafficking, forming a “fighting method” situation with law enforcement, the anti-abduction operation is bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and popularizing common sense of the law will also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and Refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing, filtering and other treatments to remove foreign objects.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels：
Extra Virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with an elegant and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): the acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or it becomes a “secondary oil”.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels：
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile the taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5% and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or Olive Pomace Oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is olive oil extracted from the oil residue by dissolution method and refined.
If you have read the grade classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruits are just like grapes for making wine. Olive fruits from different regions and different olive fruit varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olives：
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and precipitation required for olive growth.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production area (Mediterranean Sea)：
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates are Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on at far southern latitudes.
Olive picking month：
Every year from March to June, it is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, and the fruits transition from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrients of olive oil：
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
The democracy summit ended, Biden said the fire of freedom will never go out
The online “Summit for Democracy” convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments of 110 countries around the world, as well as leaders of civil society and the private sector, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global “Democracy Summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and a member of the Government Affairs Committee, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, because I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the flame of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world.  ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the buffering and shock forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.  ”
The themes of the second day of the ”Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with ”International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reiterate common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolutely condemning all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.  ”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong delivered a speech to the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all the (resources) we have to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority.  ”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat (the CCP) poses to our democratic values.
And this is why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change.  ”
Tang Feng, a member of the Administrative Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, attended the round-table discussion on “Combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values” and released the "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and we have also played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't need to take it off the shelves to defeat fake information.  ”
At the same time as the second day of the ”Democracy Summit" was scheduled, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that have been found to have seriously violated human rights in accordance with the law, and at the same time imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't hold on, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive beat will normally be more friendly than the cheap beat. This kind of “entry-level beat” is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't stand it, and it is difficult for the masters to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult. I know you can't learn it. I also know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones. Make a bargain to fool you. If you play twice, you won't play again. This beat is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. Come to me to buy expensive ones when the time comes, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price and buy a better second-hand racket. Choose prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets can't sell for the price. The new racket is 500 or 600. It's good. The second-hand one is 200 yuan. Isn't it good to have a thousand yuan shot?
It is very friendly to novices, but it is tasteless as soon as it passes the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times. Delivery time

In fact, there is a lot of attention to the dressing and matching of girls with slightly fat bodies.
Girls with fat bodies should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length is almost at the knee, just to cover the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be revealed.
Being too long will give people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear it in three sections, the upper, middle and lower, it will appear that you have naturally increased your height, that is, the upper body, skirt and stockings are in different colors, and it will look slender.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are standard for fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fatness. Noble and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice for fat girls. .
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially short black skirts, will make people think you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much to attract attention.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So as not to make people feel obese when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fatter, they must talk about the tricks of dressing and matching.
Fat girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts. In addition, the tops should not be too short or stuffed in the skirts, which will make people uncomfortable to look at. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind of thin plaid), choose a soft printed flared skirt, and match it with a top with a swing collar, which can cover up the shortcomings of fat girls well.
Of course, chubby girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts, and they should choose tops that match the color of the short skirts, which will increase the height of your fat body.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender. This is the most suitable match for summer!
If you are an MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous one-piece skirt.
Not only can it cover the big belly, but it can also show your advantages.
The A-line short skirt will be very thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. The tops should be more tight-fitting, and the formation of a sense of layering will be more thin.
A simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, fat MM can also try it.
Chubby girls can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, the fat girls will also be the focus of much attention.
After making changes in dressing and collocation, you should also exercise more in your life, and strive to get rid of the label of fat girls one day earlier.

Xinhua All Media+丨beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Fuels enthusiasm for the Winter Olympics-Xinhua
On December 11th, Pang Yaotian (middle), a player of the Beijing Dream ING team, shot in the game.
On the same day, the 2021-2022 Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued to compete in major ice rinks in Beijing.

After more than ten years of development, the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has become a platform for Beijing youth ice hockey enthusiasts to learn skills and make friends, and to transport outstanding players to the Beijing youth ice hockey team and youth team.

The girl used the target as a target to raise funds for her sister: "It's okay to think of a flesh wound"-Xinhua
A girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, stood in front of a large wooden board with the words “Human target, ten yuan per arrow” written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of “Hangzhou girl willing to be a ‘target'to raise money for her sister” maxed out the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a human. The words “Human target, ten yuan per arrow” are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move after raising money for her sister, but this behavior was not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' street "archery target" fundraising was warned
In the picture posted on the Internet, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board in the shape of ”a“. The words ”Human target, ten yuan per arrow" are written in black ink on the wooden board. Her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay accounts are written on another wooden board in front of her.
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believed that this move was a “beggar's begging behavior”, and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
“We discovered the situation when we patrolled to the side of the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. There were already a lot of onlookers at that time.  ”
The police at the Tianshui police station near the incident site said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stall, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed up as young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was the “human target” kept crying, begging passers-by to play this game; the other girl yelled for help on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.  ”
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Beijing News that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since the treatment still costs more than 300,000 yuan, I couldn't think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but they did not participate in it. No one was found to shoot arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, “This kind of fundraising method is not advocated.”
After being warned by the police at the police station, she had already left the police station.

What is the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic Projects where Project managers can Impact Gold Medals" is very popular. It is mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match it: moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers. Fighting fires, carrying pots, and apologizing are even more of a cinch.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the powerlessness of the current project management work.
And people engaged in project management work have gradually chosen to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the rising number of applicants for PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants across the country is nearly 600,000, the number of people who have passed the PMP® certification is about 420,000, and the number of valid holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total global PMP® licenses.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the “old experience” of the past. The rapidly changing working environment allows us to know that we have to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the project management work be guaranteed to be unimpeded after taking the PMP exam?
Many beginners in project management say that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the top ten areas of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land at work, project estimation is inaccurate, poor control sensitivity, and the project is delayed; the division of labor of members is not clear, and the “old fritters” in the team do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance. Communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance. ……

Jiexin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve"-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News website
This year's "Double Eleven" Carnival, the national online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
A variety of full-reduced red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger, and on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the ”Double Twelve“, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ”Jiexin") issued a rational consumption initiative to remind the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer Financial Literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, our residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but they show greater differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and they need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and “one old and one young” will continue to be the focus of financial education; the “Debt Status Report of Young People in China” released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance and Economics show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive profligacy" label labeled by the outside world, some young people do. There is excessive consumption and consumption behavior that follows the trend, and as a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks have been generated, and even social problems have gradually increased. Financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jiexin has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and intimate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to take practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.
In the past few years, Jiexin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young groups, including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic colleges and universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms, it has imperceptibly guided the consumption needs of young groups rationally, helped them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally planned consumption needs, and then helped them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumer borrowing misunderstandings so as not to affect personal credit reporting and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and do your best to repay on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on future economic life such as buying a car and buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Jiexin will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more suitable needs and diversified services, and continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer's lifelong and reliable consumer finance partner.

Vietnam People's Daily-Gulf Cooperation Council Addresses Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “unity and stability”.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
The Gulf Arab countries' efforts to resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar come from the requirement that they must unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and aim to meet common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate their supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US55 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandum of understanding on cooperation worth US330 billion.
The visit of the Saudi crown prince to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to save the Iranian nuclear agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—an agreement condemned by Gulf Arab countries because they believe it cannot solve the missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and at the same time propose various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is known as the loudest exhaust sound of a supercar in the new mountain area!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit, and the four-wheel drive is called LP700. Why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, Xiaobian doesn't know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. It's probably when Xiaobian's myvi reaches 30km/h, people will reach 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. Xiaobian has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching wherever they go, it's very uncomfortable! (Actually a bit cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
You have to practice the posture of getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The sound of the engine is too loud, and you will be deaf immediately after getting off the car. (But it's still cool)
The body is too large, and it will be very narrow to park in an ordinary parking space. I am afraid that I will be knocked on when the next car opens the door!
It's a bit lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (Xiaobian said it himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that drivers all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercar in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also one million!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school philosophy and value pursuits that have been accumulated for a long time in the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university has been essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our university, it emerged in the autumn of national distress, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes in the times. It advocates the value concept of “Mingde Ji Shi, cultivating Qi and governing peace” and the patriotic responsibility of “Xingxue Powerhouse”.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and talent is constantly intensifying. As an important “supply side”, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan to promote the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines in a Comprehensive Manner" demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, and at the same time puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to be among the world's first-class in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, so as to achieve “curve overtaking”?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of later development, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic standards and the quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past 5,000 years, carry forward the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to gather strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; third, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven, gather consensus and work together to optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid foundation for schools to accelerate their catch-up with the world's advanced level guarantee.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand schools. While giving full play to their advantages, each school must demonstrate its personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools must not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: first, we highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated educational environment for the integration of science and education, school-enterprise integration, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, we highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the subject system, create a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of ”Seeking truth and innovation“, the common values of ”diligence, cultivation of virtue, discernment, and faithfulness“, and ”Haina Jianghe, enlightenment and virtue, enlightenment of the people, and the state of our country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, continuously accumulate a high degree of culture and condense spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, “Haina Jianghe” emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, reflecting the mind of “the talents of the world are for my use”, and manifests itself as drawing on the high-quality concept of educating people in prestigious schools around the world; “Enlightenment and virtue” emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and perfection, which refers to the university's pursuit of the truth. At the same time, it should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality; “Kaiwu Qianmin” embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the innovation of knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests itself as reform and development, revolution and innovation; “Tree my country” emphasizes The spirit of patriotism and dedication is that the university should always share glory and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
“The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the unformed."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the national spirit can agitate each other, so as to provide inexhaustible motivation for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

The Department of Education of the Autonomous Region requires all universities in Guangxi to implement in-depth innovation and entrepreneurship training programs for college students, and strive to enable every college student to participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program while in school.
Colleges and universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and give financial support.

When NFT quickly emerged from the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on Blockchain technology. It combines a variety of gameplay methods, including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds US 88.2 million, which is directly ahead of "Glory of the King".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of “Axie Infinity” has passed on a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of Blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by Blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the company in the future, which refers to the choice of the investment target industry. First of all, we must choose an industry with a lot of room for growth, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more; secondly, we must choose an industry with good future growth, and consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, we must choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to “do the things right”, that is, to do things right.
The strategy lies in “doing the right thing”, that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, and tactics lies in landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on improving the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated Bitcoin as legal tender. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, and the cryptocurrency investment exposure has expanded again.
From the perspective of Blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

The makeup is very exquisite and the team service is also very good. This trip is very happy, a very professional team, and the seller has a good service attitude. I will introduce it to my friends and I am very satisfied.
Thanks to the photographer and makeup artist, I have a unique wedding photo.
Thank you to all the staff who took the wedding photos today, and look forward to the release of the finished film.
Taking wedding photos is simply a physical activity, especially for photographers, who run and jump.
The makeup artist was very caring and helped me design a makeup surface that suits my face shape. The photographer was humorous and funny when he was shooting, which is worthy of praise.
Thanks to my photographer and makeup artist, I can still see that I can be so beautiful in my lifetime.
Praise the woman for her beautiful eyes and generous and decent appearance. At first glance, she is a good wife and a good mother, and she will be diligent and frugal in the future.
The groom is considered to have earned it, and he is happy and beautiful in his life.
The quality of the wedding photos is really good. Just like the Internet said, the photos taken by my lover and I are very handsome and beautiful, and we are very satisfied.

The moment I saw the wedding photos, I didn't recognize myself for a while.
As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have wedding photos comparable to celebrities.
The more important thing for taking wedding photos is that both the photographer and the makeup artist are online. Fortunately, I met them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I found out that I was also a “photo cheat”.
Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions to 3 Ivy League schools such as Yale-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian—American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools—Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College-discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious schools in the United States has increased exponentially, but in these three prestigious schools in the United States, the proportion of Asian Americans has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities “continuously and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants for a long time” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that research by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in these three universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups participating in the appeal, they also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang, from a real estate agent. After many on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu consulted with Lin Mou, the family member of the owner of the house, on the details of the purchase of the factory building, he remitted 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the “Receipt of Deposit for the Sale and Purchase of the Factory Building", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. The two parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale and purchase of the factory building within one week. ”
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale and purchase of the house.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The house that I finally fancy, the deposit has been paid, and the payment for the house is ready, so I just signed the contract “one step at a time", but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing the case, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract in the end cannot be attributed only to the defendant, and it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the double return of the deposit for breach of contract liability.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer reminder] In the transaction process, we must fulfill the necessary obligations of prudence and attention.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must fulfill the necessary obligations of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other related information, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, tool and weapon democracy, and act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video. Leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, such as criticizing the invited participants, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration's true intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Schultz also participated in the video democracy Summit
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sickly. Issues such as money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, and the division between rich and poor are intensifying." Democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in his speech, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the power of authoritarian buffers and shocks, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.  "
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time.  "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend."
The United States has promised that after this democracy summit, it will launch a one-year operation, including a US倡议424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the Physical democracy Summit scheduled to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."

Richang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Environment: Well-behaved [Service bell] Service: Serving quickly "Gufa Mara Cake" My must-order mara cake is too fragrant, too soft and delicious. If you like desserts, you must try the "Dongjiang cuttlefish smooth stuffed tofu pot" soup is very delicious and the tofu is very tender and ink. . .
The taste is great, the meat is good, the service is enthusiastic
It's been a long time since I came to Richang. The fruit fishing is still so delicious & the real ingredients are sufficient. The first time I ordered the char siu bun, it was the southern taste of the soft flour I love!
The claypot rice is just the right degree of wet and dry, and the serving size is very sufficient. The signature tin foil chicken wings are as good as ever. The soup is also good, and the kale is handled relatively well. . .
The taste is great, the service is warm, the meat is good
Richang's old store was also an Internet celebrity many years ago, right? Dongdan small building, wooden floor.
The claypot rice that always has to wait a long time to eat at the door, the casserole of the claypot rice is cracked…
I haven't eaten Richang for several years, and the rise of Cantonese cuisine in various small shops has dispersed the passenger flow.
It's rare to see that there are seats when you arrive at the store. The quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
The taste is good, the meat is good, the staple food is good
Richang Takeaway.
[Rice] Meal: This time the dishes are a little disappointed.
Three cups of chicken: there are a lot of side dishes, and a little less chicken.

What is the method of drinking red brand whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red brand whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and red brand whiskey has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of red brand whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, wouldn't it ruin its mellow fragrance?
So how do you drink red brand whiskey?
Xiaobian will give you a brief introduction.
How to drink red brand whiskey：
Johnnie Walker Red Brand Whiskey is blended from about 35 kinds of Scotch whiskies. It has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch Whiskies. The rich aroma has sweet and smoky aromas.
The entrance is mellow and fresh, with a slight vanilla and strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice, or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red-brand whiskey has entered the country. In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, sparkling drinks such as red-brand whiskey + Coke or Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
In addition to neutralizing the sour taste, these sweet drinks can visually bring pleasure to people. Adding drinks can dilute the taste of the wine and change the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar is also available) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic Hongfangwei taste is a bit sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, while lemon will bring a fresh fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal tastes and hobbies.
The above three are the best ways to drink red brand whiskey. You can try it as a reference. I hope Xiaobian's introduction can help you.
Educational thinking: How to make “Xueba” and “Xueba” have their own place in university exams-Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination and change the question types of the examination so that the examination truly reflects the actual level of the students' demands.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a “hot topic”.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, coupled with different levels of learning, the learning situation is very different.
For the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there are different feelings.
Of course, if the exam question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who don't need to work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on assault before the exam. If you think of other methods, it is possible to achieve a multiplier effect with half the effort.
In this way, there has been a “strange status quo” that “Xueba” can pass the exam without investment, and even get a high score; “Xueba” usually never leaves class, homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher.
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in the university examination are not for no reason, and I believe that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote straightforwardly.
In fact, people who have been to university know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam unannounced, think of various ways to “get” the exam questions from the teacher, strive to narrow the scope of the exam, and obtain “key guidance” before the exam. It is not uncommon to even entrain a cheat sheet in the exam and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam. It is not an anecdote.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation guide, measuring the passability of a university examination lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage of the university, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject. From the point of view of knowledge, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, “I studied the basic knowledge of mathematics in college 20 years ago, but I am still studying it now, and it is still the focus.  ”
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean that the test question type is single or the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams generally form a question group, and then senior teachers in the subject co-ordinate the composition of the test papers. The examination papers are also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the test questions can be overcome to a certain extent. The situation.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual situation of teaching and learning. The questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question types, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of exams are there, students will have corresponding exam preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the students' letter of suggestion, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination of course completion exams, formulate exam paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of exam paper propositions and review links, refine the performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanically solving the problems of single types of test questions and repeated questions is an issue that universities need to face in the examination affairs. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but effort is expensive in daily life and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. It is necessary not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the student's learning situation. Both ends will be thoroughly fed. Teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a healthy interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that “Xueba” and “Xueba” have their own place.

Mrs. Jin's Wedding Photography (South Street Store) has no branch yet
Before taking the photo, because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice. The consultant Lanlan patiently arranged the time for us.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to take it.
Mrs. Jin's staff, whether it is consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are amazing.
It was the first time in my life that I formally put on makeup. Wow~ I can't believe it, I will become so good-looking one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient with makeup, and makeup is natural.
The location was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day and I didn't feel very cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time. If it was a little bit bad, he would help us organize it immediately.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy all day long when I take pictures.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn't want guests to delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, we didn't mean to add photos at all. Of the 24 photos in the direct package, none were added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at the same time, more than 7,000 packages also added more than 10,000 photos, I was stunned at that time, and I was afraid that I would choose too many)
The photos were repaired today, and Lanlan sent them to me. I saw two of them and felt that they were not very good. They immediately repaired them for me.
Turn out the photos taken by my sister before and compare them. I think I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos of Mrs. Xuanhan Jin!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah did not report birth papers due to special anti-counterfeiting paper out of stock
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been unable to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October. So far, the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairouaminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers have their information recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained a 10-month-old report by an online media that Sabah newspaper had a printing problem.
He said that the relevant problem appeared two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers who produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, which has caused delays in shipping to our country.  ”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper is different from other regions, so it is not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kairouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for part of the printing work.
“The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two more working days (December 20).  ”
“We will notify applicants to go to various branches to collect the application papers.  ”
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 student papers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock until now
Is that coming soon?
I mean food
I'm waiting opposite #PRS_ORG# again
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready

The Party and the country have achieved new major achievements in various undertakings.
An important aspect of the ”14th Five-Year Plan" to achieve a good start is that it has taken new steps to build a new development pattern and achieved new results in high-quality development.
Our country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control have maintained a global leading position, and the characteristics of strong development resilience, great potential and sufficient motivation continue to appear; the national strategic scientific and technological strength has accelerated, major innovative achievements have emerged, the ability of scientific and technological innovation has continued to improve, and new breakthroughs have been achieved in key core technological research; the resilience of the industrial chain has been improved, the volume of foreign trade has increased in quality and quality, and the structure has continued to be optimized.

The pace of green and low-carbon transformation has been steady, and new results have been achieved in ecological and environmental protection.

Super convenient, just like opening it on the computer, it solves the problem of insufficient hard drive on my computer.
The brand-new solid-state mobile hard drive that just arrived today cannot be read by the mobile solid-state drive computer, and the mobile solid-state drive computer does not recognize it, but it can be read by the U disk computer.
The machine is very light to use, with an atmospheric and beautiful appearance.
After using it all afternoon today, the heat dissipation is very good, and it basically doesn't feel hot. The running speed is very fast, and the boot kills 99% of users in seconds.
The battery is also very strong, with 9 hours of standby and 4 hours of use. There should be no problem. In short, I feel very happy to be able to buy a machine of this quality at this price. I will add other functions when I find out later.
The appearance is very good.
In terms of performance, it will be evaluated after a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than imagined, and the rendering effect is leveraged. I like it, and I will review it after a while.
Not bad, the serial number of the machine was checked in Hong Kong, and the quality should be OK.
**It doesn't feel big, it's heavy. It's not big if you can't hold it with one hand. It's just a little bit bigger than 15.6 inches. It's really stable to run, and it doesn't feel stuck. The sound of the fan dissipating heat is gone, it feels very good, and it won't keep turning like a game book.
The things are good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and I also sent a backpack, which I think is very good.
The service of the store is also good, reminding me to update the bios and issue it in time.
Worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation is very good, basically no heat, lightness: easy to carry, appearance material: Thinkpad traditional design, satisfactory
Reputable sellers, carefully check the appearance of the whole machine, all interfaces, no traces of refurbishment or use, it is indeed a brand new US version of the machine, the configuration is the same as the page.
I forgot to send the backpack, and immediately reissued a backpack for me. Although it is not the standard original backpack, the service follow-up is enough to prove that it is a conscientious seller.
If a friend needs to buy a notebook, then repurchase it.
Appearance material: Appearance, atmosphere, display effect: The screen resolution is ok, clear, and lightness: more textured, after all, the heavier the thing, the better it feels.
Heat dissipation effect: I tried it at the beginning, and I will evaluate it later.
The keyboard is pretty good for typing, and a mouse and converter are also sent. This configuration is still very affordable compared to the National Bank. In general, the price is cheap and beautiful. If the machine performance is good, wait for a period of time before evaluating it.
This screen is really comfortable!
The use is very smooth, it will take a while to review again!

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone”, the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requesting to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint defense and control mechanism of the State Council has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring persons who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test certificate, and those who go to land border port cities will undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, regions and cities determine the scope of the port city and announce it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions can study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of a zoning and differentiated management policy has changed from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense. It is expected to move the threshold forward, compress the risk of spillovers from the epidemic, and achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this has exposed problems such as untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some places, inadequate closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, the flow of regular nucleic acid testing, the failure of all links of cold chain items to be eliminated, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the emergency response to the epidemic is not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of port cities' prevention and control, and to do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and to weave a tight line of defense against foreign imports.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate the supply of basic living materials, prices and other hidden dangers, and promptly solve and proactively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in it include the counties (cities, districts, and flags) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, and unions) where they are located, and the municipalities directly under the Central Government. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and shall be announced in a timely manner.

The truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military in the tubing video-Xinhua
(Video source: tubing)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the tubing platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of “counter-terrorism” and forcibly exporting American democracy through the war. For 20 years, it has been militaristic, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Indiscriminate drone strikes on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distort human nature, and set up murderous groups.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison” to torture and physically humiliate "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American “war on terrorism” is “more anti-terrorism and more terrorist.”
The war did not bring peace, democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people. All it brought was a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let us come together to expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of “counter-terrorism” in the United States, and expose the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article. From the perspective of business and the shelf life, I talked about why this customer wants the logistics company in the free trade zone to help with canning. Although canning belongs to deep processing, it does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bagged milk powder and the bagged milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of listening packs is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive ones are the good ones.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the listening device is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why listening is expensive, where is it expensive?
Their raw materials are the same, why is the difference so large?
Because when manufacturers price, most of them take into account that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening equipment to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening, not bagging.
Also, you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising dollars every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotion staff of shopping malls, the display costs of shopping malls, the cost of product gifts, and the cost of advertising, etc., are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and the price of listening to the installation is also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, do whatever it takes to hook up with doctors in the hospital, and they will assist in the promotion of the products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from the first listen.
However, China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation. In fact, this approach is harming consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bags of milk powder and put it in cans under the premise that they have cans at home. This can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which will not have any effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of the listening package is longer than that of the bag. If the listening package has the same shelf life as the bag after the package is opened, it is just that the bag is not easy to store after the package is opened, and it is susceptible to moisture and deterioration.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it was cold, it was dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it at all.

Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhua
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful academic books.
Many of today's success books promote the “best principle”—that is, first assume or imply that you can “do it”, and then tell you what you need to do “what”.
It is tantamount to saying that the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it” has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature—either just do your best with a bang, or just don't do anything at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This kind of “best principle”, anyone who looks at it will admit that it is “extremely correct”, but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you have to make up your mind, become a new person, and have a 180-degree transformation”, and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow the rules, and refuse to change, you have to shout “You want to change” in his ear. It is undoubtedly a move to deceive yourself and play the piano to the cow.
Most people will be timid before the “transformation” two days, hesitant, and difficult to make up their minds; or they have made up their minds to “transform” with a momentary impulse, and bravely took the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they will be defeated if they don't hold on for a long time, and it is difficult to see continuity.
The famous cross talk of Mr. Ma Sanli's "Starting from Tomorrow“ is the most expressive expression of this ”universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making most people “look at the door and sigh.”
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that may enable more ordinary people to embark on the road to relative success.
The core of the “second—best principle” lies in “lowering the threshold”—it encourages a theory of “accumulating small victories for big victories”, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not doing it.
Since the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success that follows the “second-best principle” is slightly longer.
All in all, although the ”best principle“ is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, there are actually a few that it can ultimately motivate; and the ”second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection period in 2002.
The common name of the naked carp in Qinghai Lake is "Huangyu". It is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake and plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as man-made mass killing and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake closure for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and drainage, the cleaning of the main rivers and rivers entering Qinghai Lake, and the design of scientific and reasonable “fish passage”, protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million koi in Qinghai Lake have been artificially proliferated and released, and the contribution rate to the restoration of koi resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in my country and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing bans in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of “one river, one river and one lake”.

I just saw an article about holidays, it's too long.
Let's popularize science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first regular vacation on a certain day during the age of 13-15, and they will have amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come more regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be accurately predicted. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes bad luck will overturn the car (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; some people shed less, and some people have a lot of blood; some people have no response, and some people are so painful that they are transported away by ambulance. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. Not painful before does not mean that it will not be painful for a lifetime.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds for 24 hours within a few days from the beginning to the end. All you can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes and chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking Brofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period before it has time to have dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take it after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you have diarrhea around the time of the cycle, you will basically have menstruation within two days.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced every two or three hours, otherwise they are easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. In the worst case, they are replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the prepared portion in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not every month. Use one piece.
(Modify it here, you don't have to change the tampons often, you can change them once in about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal disturbances during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation may also be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body stumbles on itself.
However, the official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed endometrium.
The endometrium after menstruation is the thinnest, and then it slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, they will all be demolished (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, it bleeds 24 hours a day for a few days a month, and there will be abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants to?
But a person can be born because his mother has menstruated. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was it, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that the preparation behavior of the female body for giving birth to life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and stop thinking like this. Men who have never experienced it before and will never experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can this attitude mean to face one's own mother, how can one mean to want one's own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Today is the winter Solstice festival, and it's more disappointing to send it wrong.
I have to order another meal for the children to eat
I hope the shop will have to check it out in its busy schedule.
Is the numbness of the foot soaking in the foot bath leaking electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in pedicure and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming more and more popular with consumers. A large number of products of different grades have also emerged in the market, ranging from more than one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan. A wide range of foot baths, giving consumers a lot of choice. Room.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-care appliances such as foot basins are popular in sales, but there is no special industry standard for foot basins, so there are certain safety risks.
“It's too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water! ”
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath at first, but he didn't expect that when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, and the electric pen turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this foot bath, which has been popular for a long time, now does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, there will be no electrical problems with foot basins, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a split foot bath.
The water and electricity are separated without any safety risks.
At the same time, you can take a test with an electric pen at will.

Hunan Daily News, December 10 (All-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Council of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperation Association, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into “colorful Hunan Tea”.

The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main teas such as green tea, black tea, and black tea have taken turns to promote the integration of tea tourism in the main tea-producing areas, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.

Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the trademark “Hunan Black Tea”, and Xinhua celebrated the “Source of Lake red”.
In the Xinhua Black tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high-mountain tea called “Binglichun” and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, was happy to say that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many highlights.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, popular and popular, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore. Because there is no parking below, he failed to deliver it.

The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "to study which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns only represent a concept."

Chè (chè), whose real name is Jiang Bo, was born in the year of the Sheep, the month of the sheep, on the grass of the sheep, which is suitable for the sheep, and he is called "Uncle Yang".
Because of the publication of the ”Exotic Password" series of works such as "Thai Alien Records", "Indian Alien Records", "Japanese Alien Records", and "Korean Alien Records", he is known as a “suspense geek” in the industry, claiming to be “good at talking nonsense solemnly.”

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in my personal name in early 1994, the assistance has not been interrupted so far.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up into families.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped us families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have also retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to suspend humanitarian donations to our difficult-Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end a long time ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the National Federation of Students (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian assistance, the National Federation of Students and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often intersect.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the people who are difficult to reach on June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the “Tiananmen Mothers” to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th Orphan Special Hardship Fund for the Elderly", which has been implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th, from generous donations from individuals, and were supported by the Foundation for Democracy of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the members of the June 4th Family finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of June 4th that year.
During this period, "China Human Rights" was also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's suspension of donations on June 4th is for the consideration of donors. We are indeed all retirees. Our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I hereby express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his “To Friends” letter.
We will respect the decision of the difficult members, terminate this project within two years, and resume immediately when needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have insisted on giving generously for many years and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian relief funds.

Thank you rabbit for your comment. I originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to come out. It's so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction will enable us to move forward with full power, and we will continue to cheer!
This photography studio is really great. I highly recommend all my friends to come!
It is impeccable from reception, makeup, costume, lighting, photography to post-production.
The makeup artist is very delicate, and will match the makeup that suits you according to your style, and the cosmetics are all first-line big brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite a major.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing with it.
We are working in Beijing. Better photo studios in Beijing need to line up half a year in advance. Colleagues have filmed in Beijing. After watching the finished film, I feel just so so.
I deliberately searched for this studio, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor. I think this is also a short version of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, an excellent team.
When it came out into a film, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have recommended my best friend in the past, and my best friend is also full of joy just after watching the negatives.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover ta and shoot it in their own style, rather than the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jingling. Both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like us, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for your acquaintance.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice, a wonderful shooting, a very unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting is much better than I thought. Everyone has worked hard, thank you very much.
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comments. Knowing you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust in us is thousands of kilometers away. So many. I'm very happy to meet you. I have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I pay?

Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A programming white who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have any ideas in this area, it's best to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, it depends on the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, the faculty strength of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, check out this training institution. It is best to check out the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because you haven't made a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will have something to do with the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one is the high cost of learning, and the other is the investment of more time, and the basic need is to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situation I'm talking about, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are also many training resources at Station B. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or a detailed consultation is fine.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that the study does not have to be very strenuous, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, and some people have special answers to questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion places, and recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview process of looking for a job can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views. Because I don't understand your situation, I will only introduce it in general and not in detail. If you have anything else you want to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said I arrived before 1 o'clock, I saw it all in the app
What do you mean
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
In person, undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted furnaces, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping services
Thank you to those who silently praised me. I'm tired of working hard for life, but I have to continue.
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard. If you like it, follow me. Thank you to those who like me silently.
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, and they support the process by themselves. Facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back but we can't go back.……
Cleaning is work and duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude. Seeing the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the fatigue at that moment is worth it, and the effort will eventually be rewarded!
My daily work
——Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, and keep the beauty.
For the details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping has helped you do my best to “clean” and serve your family.
Keep the Wanjia clean, build a monument to the housekeeping, the service is in place, and the home is clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it be overflowing with brilliance, and the same is true in life.
Only by doing it with your heart can you succeed, and we are serious about shaping exquisite and beautiful seams with meticulous care.
Give me the opportunity and I will definitely satisfy you. The quality says everything, because the profession is worthy of being trusted, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
All walks of life are not easy to do at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent enough, and hard enough, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining.”!
The plan of the day lies in the morning. All the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishful thinking, and maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I achieved it; when I matured, I found that happiness turned out to be a state of mind, and happiness when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is one way in life, go your own way; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and live beautifully until you get old!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you meet difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
China-Saudi curators jointly organized the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District located in the northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. Tian Feiyu, curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, serves as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is “Crossing the river with a stone”, which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River with a Stone", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Marginal Thinking", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibits, including various forms such as painting, installation art and performing art; the works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists used recycled materials in novel ways to create. For example, Xu Bing used waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in "The Story Behind the Series of Endless Pictures of Xishan" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hopes that this biennale will establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is twofold, not only to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also to integrate the Saudi audience into the world of contemporary art.  ”
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the biennale. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Co-ordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare positions-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping the poor to get out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the employment of difficult rural groups such as the poverty-stricken labor force, and has played an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people achieve employment and income, consolidate the achievements of the fight against poverty, and effectively enhance the rural public service capabilities.
The new regulations were jointly issued by the Yunnan People's Social Service, rural revitalization, finance and other seven departments. They mainly standardize the scope of targets, fund management, job development, and job management for the recruitment of rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and they are set up in accordance with the principles of “setting posts on demand, assigning people by post, dynamic management, and total control”, “Who develops, who uses, and who is responsible” and “one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management”.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement of induction.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial accidental injury insurance for the placement of rural public welfare positions; relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can I cancel the order
I re-place the order
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the right has had an era of ambition in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is bright when you give a little sunshine, and sweaty when you drink a little boiling water; if you get a little ambition, you will be happy, and if you are hit, you will be attached to it.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
In terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social issues seriously. Take it seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-communist revolution is necessary. Revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people's livelihood, and political groups are mixed with fish and dragons. Then foreign countries take advantage of the void to enter.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make political speculation shudder are not rightists, but bastards.
Let's talk about the left again.
Zuo, in fact, is a group of outcast children of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing remarks and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this kind of creation, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the left madness while fighting against the thief, and they were quite angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with traitors and Zuo Lunatics. They are all the same, and they are unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti-thief and Zuo Fan admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: when the anti-thief scolds you for fifty cents, and when the left crazy scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but become paranoid.
Gradually drifting away from the ideal, even the dragon slayer boy eventually became a dragon.
I think the left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes from history and culture cause China as a whole to be left-leaning.
The domestic right is liberal and pays attention to efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Now society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are fighting each other. The left is certain, and it is estimated that it will last for many years.
Although I can't understand it, it's over if I like it.
Don't say anything, Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US emperor has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused “American” companies to suffer huge losses.
The U.S. emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies in allied countries to blockade China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers. , Resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chain disorders.
Nowadays, the ”lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the price increase of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of “chips”, technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move towards the road of “de-beautification”.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old United States has recently taken frequent actions and hosted the “Chip Summit”; it also invited 64 giants to form a semiconductor alliance and drew funds to support local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, a veteran technology giant in the United States, spent US220 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, it was very likely to take away TSMC's “rice bowl”.
The reason for this certainty is because Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, regarding Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the “2021 Masters Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou said amazingly. Regarding Intel's move to build a FAB, Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples and said bluntly: Intel built a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still brooding about a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the U.S. manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and is the world's overlord in the semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by a factory from design, manufacturing to packaging and testing. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then it is possible to set up a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of “wafer processing”, does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a minion in front of Intel, a big Mac.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obvious that some people regarded TSMC too highly and looked down on TSMC. Decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at the time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now also going to start foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into foundry was ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel.
Facing TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Can't wait
The order will be placed for 2 hours by 19:06😅
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Huolala incident. The spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipated. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They look exactly the same as the [Online Public Opinion Evolution Model] once displayed on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak-like], [jagged], and [cliff-like].
[Lone peak shape] That is, artificial heating, quickly rushes to the hot search, attracting public attention; [jagged shape] that is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [cliff shape] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search completes the “function”, receives a new task, and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event happens to be the trough of another event. The time is not bad in minutes and seconds. It must be a unified group of naval forces that received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, and which blackmail decision-making. The black-produced accounts are refined into battles in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Wherever we walk, we will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first case of infection with the Omicron strain-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th, Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the new crown mutant virus.
Mauritius reported two cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After isolation and treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
All three of them are students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. They were not admitted to the hospital for treatment because they were all mildly ill.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik virus, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in the country.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer New Crown vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Kunbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country has found three cases of infection with the Omikwe strain for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 positive samples of the new crown collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these three cases of infection.

Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 for a basic decoration.
When I came to the store, I started a series of deceptions.
This is the first time I came to the store. I just showed them my apartment plan. They didn't go to the field to measure the house. They were able to give me a quotation saying that my 135 house is 70,000 yuan. It can be done. I probably showed me their materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that as long as you arrive at the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you will never be able to return it unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
There are many problems with the quotation he gave me. 70,000 does not include the renovation of water and electricity, and does not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three are the bulk of the cost of basic installation.
Excluding these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at the beginning.
When I went to them for a refund, they showed that they were very experienced and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.
In any case, it is the customer's problem that will bite to death. They are completely irresponsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities, there are still many details, I don't want to say one by one, it's all tears, in short, don't choose them, because the house my friend found them to decorate is also of poor quality, and I will calculate various expenses for you later.
Cheating, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, but now it has been changed to Damei, as if it has gone out of business and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a cheating decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you can take a look at these on Baidu and check these consultations because the decoration is not a small amount of money.

It's so scary, if you don't get it within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money in 5 to 10 days, you will be held accountable.
I asked if I can cancel in less than 15 minutes.

There is an appointment in the starry sky 丨 The Gemini meteor shower ushered in a great day on the 14th-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern hemisphere, will usher in a great day on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the day.
The Gemini meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200-year-old asteroid Faer, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not “conceived” by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like New Year blockbusters, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the “release schedule” can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. Together with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseus meteor Shower, it is called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A distinctive feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow, rich in colors, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners to shoot.
The Gemini meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will usher in a great time around 15:00 on December 14th. At the extreme time, ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is directly above the head of the sky, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour) is 150.
Gemini Meteor shower recommended index chart.
“Last year, the Gemini meteor shower of "Falling in the Sky" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the excitement will be discounted a little.
The 14th is the 11th of November of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is the full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but pay attention to keeping warm from the cold.  ”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets. Visual observation can be done.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous ‘meteor shower blockbusters’, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential.  ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between LASER TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points：
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the fully rolled out market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TVs shipped and sold worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the irritation to the eyes is smaller.
The Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and ophthalmologists of Beijing Union Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparative tests of people watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, most of the current prices of commercially available laser TVs are above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price has gradually risen.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is compact and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. There are pros and cons to everything. After weighing it, you can judge for yourself. I'm afraid I'll listen to one-sided words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel screens is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point is that I especially hate projection manufacturers to use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, you can't see it. If you have to be more serious, LCD TVs are also diffuse "direct light”. Isn't the CEILING illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it will not be an image at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen that is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
The preferred quality store of the Cultural Photography Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum does not have a branch yet
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister will send me the optional time schedule, and the reply information will be more timely~
Before I went, I saw the shooting works in the store. They were more outdoor wedding dresses. The shots were very beautiful and there were many shooting styles involved.
After arriving that day, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with the little sister, and very patiently helped me try two sets of my tangled style clothes, and finally finalized the makeup and styling~ The photographer will set up some props before shooting, will guide the actions, and strive for excellence in every detail.
But maybe because I didn't exchange specific shooting ideas with me, the style I wanted was not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking.
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help select the photos and exchange the later styles. I feel very careful.
The repaired film will take about half a month, wait for the effect~
For the second time, I won the overlord meal event in the photo category~ Most of the clothes in the audience can choose one to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours. Makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s. It feels a little bit sentimental. I hope I can give more suggestions in the future in terms of customer shooting action guidance~ It's very talkative, and the shooting process is more enjoyable.
Cultural photography, visual aesthetics, photography museum, preferred quality store reply
It's the first page, let's take a look at Queenie too~
When you arrive at the store, you first fill in your name and phone number and then choose a costume. You can choose a wedding dress. You can change three or four sets of costumes. It's quite patient. After choosing it, you have to put on makeup for a long time. The service attitude is also good. The shooting will teach you how to pose. It just feels like you have a big face when you shoot it. It takes half a month to refine it. It was sent in three or four days. It feels like it's no different from the original film.
[Environment] Overall, it's okay.
There are many optional clothes.
There are almost three makeup locations, and there is a studio inside.
[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make up the shot.
[Experience] The shape may be a bit too much, the original double eyelids were posted with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows was also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't draw thrushes every day.
The photos have been given for more than ten days, but the effect of the P-picture is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets, but I still chose a black dress. The little sister said that this set is more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up and hair. The hair stylist and makeup artist, Miss sister, are super patient and are helping me get it out. The effect is very satisfactory.
After I got my makeup and hair done, I started taking pictures. The photographer instructed me to pose throughout the process. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming, I carefully selected four of my favorite ones. The little brother said that the ending of the film in 15 days is very satisfactory~
There has been no reply for 3 days... Since your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG#plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment
I have to pay the freight every time now
You can waive it first, and then charge my monthly fee after you have completed the investigation. Is this okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
Judging from the setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three conditions must be met: shareholders and sponsors have no major illegal records in the last three years, and the minimum amount is RMB 50 million before it can be established, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very demanding. In summary, they must be strong, approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good style of work. As a small umbrella insurance for an insurance brokerage company, the insured does not have to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds that not all insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform. For example, the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical illness insurance is on the shelves. The claimant and the underwriting party are both Hetai Life. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesperson wages, the price ratio of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payment, reduces the pressure on policyholders to pay, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the businessperson: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements. Many Internet product customers can insure their own insurance. There will be many misunderstandings in this way. In terms of health and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or in line, so it is easy to have many hidden dangers of claims, and there may be a risk of being refused compensation.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in ”Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Xiaoyu Umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I tell you very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It is people who are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy and will not tell the policyholder. The first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is subject to normal charges, ranging from tens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for one or two years. It is unclear what they bought.
Thinking that it could cost 1 yuan, the insurance company paid 6 million (the world lost the pie).
The free mobile phone is given only for special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888 with the tail number of the policy, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not redeem it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the policyholder.) Receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance for free is short-term. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of a serious illness, 60,000 yuan will not solve the problem, and you will start to run naked in your future life.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So overall, there is no problem with the platform and no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject carefully consider it comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers can choose from more opportunities and products. The price/performance ratio of some products is also better than that of Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and each person saves 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in business management training, has served nearly a thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from customer needs and tailor insurance products for customers. During the insurance process, I will shop around for customers and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After applying for insurance, I will organize and manage the policies for customers, so that customers can rest assured. Worry-free.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business where the policyholder can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a “sense of ceremony”, and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, that is, follow-up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we purchase insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can stay with us for a long time and will provide us with services in many years?

There is no problem, remember that there is no need to arrange a resend, I have purchased separately, I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we just have to put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing you have to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, and then published ridiculing posts, to the time you tried to post the so-called location of my home and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
In the future, you will intensify your efforts not only to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to brazenly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some vague and humiliating remarks about me, appearance, figure, good health, and what kind of bed to grow strawberries, do you want to insert such messages, I. . . Forget it.
How do you know that later, I received a number of friends about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing remarks on your Facebook friend account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer be silent.
After the news of my call to the police was uploaded, you did not converge at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, both sexes need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridicule, obscenity, humiliation, and abuse. You can also continue to say that you just care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not a picture made by you or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there will be any girl who is willing to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say that she is okay after being so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic morals will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is at ease in people's hearts.
I cut off part of the message for everyone to comment
No one should be able to pretend to be you in the posts you posted by yourself, right?
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
Smile knowingly

The main stream of the Yangtze River realizes full coverage of the green integrated service area on the water-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing Fuling Aquatic Green Integrated Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second aquatic green integrated service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Aquatic Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province was listed and operated on the 8th.
So far, the water green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of crew members and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.

The three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China. Rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional pro-CCP media Multidimensional report: Latest news on Sino-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China; U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, releasing important signals to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank “South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform”, on January 9, the satellite discovered the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will go to the South China Sea for deployment.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier ”Carl Vinson“ has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 ”Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the “Carl Vinson”, the U.S. aircraft carrier that is now cruising in the Pacific Ocean, there is also the “USS Abraham Lincoln” (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" was also equipped with an F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser "Lake Champlain“ and the guided missile destroyer ”Stockdale".
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the ”South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China.
(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and visited Guam on January 17, 2022. The flight route of the U.S. carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said this was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratlys in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongsha Island in the Spratlys.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the United States' capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomer submarines" (Boomer submarine).
The whereabouts of the 14 “thunder submarines” in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines have made the ”Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity”" This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers that can carry nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the market capitalization of 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded that he is "facing unprecedented competition." What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Nowadays, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook Inst Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance”. Many apps are external to Meta's advertisements, and monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data and information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google takes another stab next, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its office in Hong Kong, and there are also several major agents in the mainland.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Bytedance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from Bytedance in the first two years.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte go to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically understood it recently, but it will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going well.
Facebook is getting older and older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the “Meta universe”.
Meta universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of Meta universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the past two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current very beautiful scenery. It also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion U.S. dollars. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily life and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and it is a blink of an eye between subversions.
And the unattainable concept of engaging in the Meta universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name again and kept looking for new tracks. The root reason, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
