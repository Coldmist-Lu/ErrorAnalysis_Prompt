At the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University last night, a series of brain-opening achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students.Their research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical science, life science, humanities education, etc.The students have created many high-end inventions with application value from a curious point of view, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensors: Your Family Physician
Zhang Di-ming, a Ph.D. student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor that is only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you have to do is take a gentle breath, and the device will make a preliminary assessment of your health from the gaseous components you are exhaling.”
The sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report is displayed on the phone when the gas is exhaled, Zhang Diming said.
There are smart wristwatches on the market that can detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
The biosensor, which uses a new material called graphene, targets chemical elements and uses a keen sense of smell to provide a deeper and more accurate picture of a person's health.
Smart Surgery Lamp: Doctors' High-Performance Eyes
In addition to smartphones, the operating room is equipped with smart operating lights.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, graduate students of the Institute of Optical and Electrical Sciences and Engineering, have opened a new way of thinking in the flaws of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
“Many of the early detection and irreversible removal of diseases are related to the lights used in doctors’ operating rooms.”
'For example, in early cancer screening, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread,' Shen said.
This smart surgical lamp has four light panels that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of patches at any time, depending on the need for surgery and personal habits.
The smart surgical light has been tested in Shao Yifu Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: water-saving and stylish
Ordinary people wash their hands by washing with water, rubbing soap on the top, and squeezing hand-washing liquid, while students such as Li Kaizhang invented an “air hand-washing device.”
As long as we stand on the washstand of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and is combined with the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
Color-reaction and bacterial residue experiments have shown that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, can guarantee the level of cleaning, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold prize.

Okay, I'm in trouble.
A certificate that I think makes a lot of sense - a first-aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I consider important besides the driver's license!
First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before an ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a long way to go before an ambulance arrives in the aftermath of an accident, and this is the crucial time.
This is the time when you need first aid.
If I do have a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, a respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So the people around know how important first aid is!
When someone falls by our side, we can rescue them with professional knowledge, instead of just standing there and doing nothing. It's a terrible feeling of helplessness.
“In China, our official figures show that three million people die accidentally each year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15 percent can be saved.
Seventy-eight percent of casinos in Las Vegas can be saved, compared to less than one percent in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is what the first reaction founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you pinch the person has no effect.
It is necessary to do artificial breathing and pressure outside the chest to be able to rescue the person.
I find that few of us are aware of the need to learn first aid right now, but it's too late when things happen, so I call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond to emergencies in a timely manner.
Maybe it could save a man's life!
The first-aid certificate can be enrolled at your local Red Cross training center. I enrolled at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have a discount.
PS: The last picture shows you the goal you want to achieve by the age of 25, adding your first aid certificate to the list of goals a few months ago, but it's done!
Then go to the examination of other wanted to examine the certificate, intend to examine a diving certificate, before the small red book saw another diving emergency certificate, the examination of this certificate seems to have to have an emergency certificate to go to the examination, so in fact the emergency certificate is still very useful!

First of all, to conclude, I personally think that "Shikai" is an all-round crappy film, in all senses.
But if you're going to say that there's not a single bright spot in this movie, then at least the soundtrack isn't too good.
Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Kang is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it looks like it's a creation from a Crimean novel. It's unremarkable, and it's as leaky as a sweater on a kid's coat.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's any metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it's just a piece of shit.
To begin with, let me briefly describe some of the plots that I find difficult to understand.
The man's place of residence was supposed to be on a small island to the south, where he lived with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a neighbor's grandfather to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
An elderly man sees snow from the south to the northeast in a van?
He and his father are still very relieved about this.
Then the old man didn't write.
How does a landlady's brother get a license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
On the island flying party small crowd Why can you lightly and smoothly block off a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck that delivered the reinforcement in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and the truck driver could not be found all around.
The feel of the tool is too obvious.
Why would an untrustworthy and illegally suspected gangster become an aide-de-camp?
Faced with high interest rate loans why not call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there is a difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door in a hotel with a room card, then forcibly arranges not to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the door of the room to sleep?
This mysterious plot pervades the whole film, and it pains me when I recall it because it's so bizarre.
Aside from the plot, what's even worse is the film's subject matter, or the fact that the film has no subject matter at all, and it's a hideous-looking sewing freak.
At the beginning of the movie you think he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an encouraging film, halfway through you think it may be a drama that shows how difficult it is for a small town youth to survive, and after watching it you don't know exactly what you saw, followed by a deep suspicion of yourself, why go to the movie theater to enjoy the big over the year.
For most people, you're actually pretty familiar with all kinds of movie scenarios. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, enthusiasm + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented bird of prey progresses to success one step at a time.
If you want to make a love movie, you have to tell the truth about the feud between a young man in a small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and a maid's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot shouldn't contradict the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's new motorcycle has just been burned down, and then he's still a singing character), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the fact that the hostess is not weak-minded and can act in some ways like a five-year-old child, I really do not know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I also don't understand why Han Kang, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies.
This kind of film is arranged in the Spring Festival stalls, is not it to give the audience a blockade?

Yesterday, a reporter from the city's Education Commission was informed that starting this year, the city will conduct a pilot "modern apprenticeship" training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training will simultaneously have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees of the units.
In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, students, schools and enterprises shall sign tripartite agreements.For students who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, students, guardians, schools and enterprises shall sign tripartite agreements to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, contents of teaching and protection of rights and interests of the students being trained.
The pilot schools shall be encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship system in conjunction with cooperative enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the training model.
Schools and enterprises shall jointly design personnel training programmes and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
Students are required to complete a six-month apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship, and students must complete a six-month apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship in order to qualify for a full-time apprenticeship
According to the characteristics of different specialties, a master can take two to five apprentices to form a study group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each pilot numbering about 50 people, a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
We will explore the establishment of long-term effective mechanisms for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated human development of schools and enterprises, in accordance with the principle of piloting and implementing them first, and gradually advancing them from point to point, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve student-to-student employment rates and the quality of employment.

South African doctor: Omicron transmits strongly but is mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus Omicron variant is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads more rapidly.
A group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Haute-Garonne province reported that they are treating new crown patients with mild symptoms, such as body pain and coughing, similar to influenza, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, the Associated Press reported.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, says he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
“They were able to control the disease at home,” Pillay said. “Most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation.”
This includes the elderly and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from coronary virus infections, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of Delta outbreaks, he treated new-crown patients with "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized within a few days.”
Within two weeks of the first report of Omicron mutant strains in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new coronary heart disease patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severe, half the rate in the previous wave; the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3% of new coronary heart disease patients died recently, compared to 20% in early-onset cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports: “At present, there are almost all indications that this is a mild disease.”
“It is still early and we need to get the later data,” he said.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into the epidemic.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the world's leading new crown virus strain, Omicron cases are occurring in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in the first week of December in the province of Haute-Garonne increased by 400%, with tests showing more than 90% of the cases involving Omikyong mutants.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Educational commentary: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If we compare the well-known public-interest advertising phrase, "There is no killing without buying and selling," then, in a good environment without the need for "abduction," group-prevention, group-management, and nation-wide counter-abduction would make the acts of kidnapping and selling unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes would not happen again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security kidnapped and developed the missing children information emergency release platform online.
It is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
Listening to the app’s name, “Reunification,” I felt warm.
The new technologies are not only called “literature and art,” they are full of emotions, and information technology is used appropriately, practically, and effectively.
Kidnapping law enforcement, the primary objective is to find the kidnapped children, protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education, can be summed up in many broad terms.
However, priority should be given to the victim's personal safety before a kidnapping case is resolved.
The question of whether or not a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether or not a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted for the purpose of capital punishment, or whether a child should be sold or abducted
Based on the detection experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the winning.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for more than a minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the detection of the case will be one more difficult.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective way to help the detection of cases and the retrieval of children directly, such as a “reunification” platform.
After all, “kidnapping” is a major undertaking that requires the operation of an entire legal system.
Fighting crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation to the safeguarding of the judiciary, and rigorous enforcement, do not require caring for the "protection of the weak and vulnerable".
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, could be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at the railway station, the parents fall asleep and wake up to find the child missing.
One cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least have a reasonable sense of protection.
Resting alternately between the two parents or placing the child under proper protection is the least that can be done to prevent the child from being abducted.
From the other side of the police combating the crime of kidnapping and selling, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be paid attention and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just a ring in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory punishment for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years' imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a more serious crime under the general trend of "minor punishment" with a high penalty point and a maximum penalty.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in their conceptions of child-rearing and lack legal awareness.
Legal education for this segment of the population should be pursued simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the abduction "market" exists widely, if the abductors are motivated by the desire for profit, if they constantly innovate the means of abduction, and if they form a situation of "fighting" with law enforcement officials, the abduction operation will surely fall into an ineffective muddle.
Thus, the elimination of backward notions and the dissemination of legal common sense will also help to eradicate the crime of child abduction and trafficking.
Statement by Yang Hodong at the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the spirit of the Provincial Party Conference
Drawing Strength from the Centennial Struggle History of the Party
According to the unification arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Hodong, made an interactive speech at the Manchukuo Garden in Malangshan, studying in depth the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Party Congress, studying the spirit of the endorsement of the important instructions given by the President of the People's Republic of China to the keynote speech of Hunan, and studying the spirit of the Twelfth Party Congress of the province.
From the three aspects of ideal conviction and original mission, self-revolution and youth, the leadership of the Party and the theory of the Party, Yang explained the core meanings and practical requirements of the spirit of the General Assembly in depth and systematically, combining his own insight and personal experience.
He pointed out that the spirit of the plenary meeting should be combined with the spirit of the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China to approve the important instructions and the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress to discuss important issues in Hunan, so as to strengthen the defence of the "Two Establishments," realize the consciousness of the "Two Maintenance," the political consciousness, the action consciousness, and steadfastly move forward in the direction guided by the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China.
In the interactive exchange session, the representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprises, and youth asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments," how to grasp the direction of cultural enterprises, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the history of the Party for a hundred years.
By 2022, the number of high school graduates in the Beijing region is expected to reach 26.8 million.

The relevant heads of the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said they would deploy jobs for graduates of Beijing's universities by enhancing supply-demand matching, strengthening policy support, broadening employment channels, ensuring assistance in difficulties, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving service efficiency.
The reporters learned that the Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will set up a practice platform, increase the supply of jobs, actively contact 40 university graduates' workplace experience bases, visit employers, integrate demand information and job information; focus on the "six batches," that is, broaden the recruitment batch of institutions, broaden the recruitment batch of state-owned enterprises, broaden the recruitment batch of grassroots projects, broaden the recruitment batch of conscripts, broaden the employment apprenticeship retention batch, broaden the entrepreneurship-led employment batch; implement the dynamic management of the "one-life policy," recommend at least five job information for each graduate, ensure that the employment intention of the difficult family graduates is achieved 100%

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two main categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
Pre-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is oil obtained directly from fresh olives by mechanical cold squeezing, filtering and other processes to remove foreign matter.
Depending on the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin olive oil: is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a subtle and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity does not exceed 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil: slightly acidic, but not more than 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: taste and flavour are still acceptable, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining primary olive oil with an acidity exceeding 3.3%, or as "secondary oil".
There are two categories of refined olive oil:
Olive oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance flavour and colour, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a translucent pale golden yellow colour.
Refined olive-pomace oil (also known as refined olive-pomace oil, refined olive-pomace oil, refined olive-pomace-pomace oil, refined olive-pomace-pomace oil, refined olive-pomace-pomace-pomace oil, refined olive-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace-pomace
You should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Olives, like grapes for winemaking, come from different regions and varieties and produce different levels of olive oil.
Where olive oil grows best:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for olive growing, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be cultivated sporadically in the temperate zone.
Main production area(Mediterranean Sea):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., as well as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. at far south latitudes have similar climates.
Month of olive harvest:
From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional Ingredients of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and oleic acids, linoleic acids, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil found to date.
At the end of the democratic summit, Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Barack Obama and attended by governments and civil-society and private-sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also says he plans to hold the second global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwanese government representative and councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy activist Luo Guanzhong, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how difficult the tasks ahead of us are," Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world.”
"Defending democracy requires a concerted effort on the part of society as a whole," Biden said.
He said: “As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to seek power nakedly before the public interest.”
The second day of the “Democracy Summit” focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
It coincides with “International Human Rights Day.”
In his opening remarks on the day, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
“The time has come to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
In a pre-recorded video address to the summit, Hong Kong's pro-democracy human rights activist Luo Guanzhong reminded participants of the continuing concerns about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
“For a long time, the world has been accepting China’s rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable,” he said.
That is why politicians and civil-society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources at our disposal to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
He also urged the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Communist Party of China.
He said: “Perhaps some of you are afraid to annoy President Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you do not recognize the threat to our democratic values.”
And that's why we failed.
That is why we must change.”
During a roundtable discussion on “Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values,” Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Council, released a video statement emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the struggle against despotism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the new plague through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy continues to flourish, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of decline.
In Taiwan, however, we don’t have to seal the city to control the epidemic; we don’t have to go underground to defeat false information.”
On the second day of the summit, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, that have been found to have violated human rights, as well as restrictions on investment in a Chinese company that has been found to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the mouthwatering chicken from the restaurant is fresh
I'd like to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up, so I'd like to find a trainer for the same price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices tend to be proportional to the degree of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then normally expensive situations are more friendly than cheap ones, which are actually industrial rubbish.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not be overcome, it is difficult to master.
The logic and subtext of their existence is-- tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn, you know you don't want to buy expensive stuff, you mess around with cheap stuff, you play twice, you don't play again, so it's cheaper and you don't care.
When you really know what's good and what's bad, it means you're making progress, and then come back and I'll buy expensive stuff here, and I'll make twice as much money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racquet, choose PRInce, or Dunlop, both brands are not famous enough, so a good racquet does not sell the price, the new 500, 600 is good, second-hand 200, the enjoyment of having a thousand yuan?
It's very friendly to beginners, but once you've passed the beginner's stage you're broke, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the beginner's stage.

In fact, a lot of attention is paid to the skinny girl's outfit matching.
A skirt worn by a fat girl shouldn't be too short or too long. It should be about knee-length, just enough to cover the fat part of her thigh.
A skirt that is too short will expose the fat on your legs.
Too long will make you feel short and fat.
If you wear the top, skirt and stockings in different colors, it will look like you are naturally taller.
In fact, many dark-colored dresses are tailored to fatty girls (the author is well aware of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, elegant black short skirts are also the favorite of fatty girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially short black skirts, will make you feel thinner.
If your thighs are too fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular it is, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
Avoid feeling fat when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it's important to know how to dress appropriately.
If the legs are thick, you should wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind of thin grid Oh), choose a soft printed horn skirt, coupled with a collared shirt, can hide the shortage of the fat girl.
Of course, little fat girls are good at wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wearing short skirts, should choose a coat that matches the color of the short skirts, so that your fat body has the effect of increasing height.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer. It's the perfect summer outfit!
If you are an overweight but thin-legged MM, we recommend choosing a gorgeous dress skirt.
Not only can you hide your belly, but you can also show your strengths.
A short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, the coat should choose a tighter, forming a sense of level will be more thin.
Simple single white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls are also able to wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they know how to dress properly, fat girls will be the focus of attention.

On 11 December, Beijing Dreaming team player Peng Yao Tian (middle) scored a goal in the match.
On that day, the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League 2021–2022 season continued to compete in Beijing's major ice hockey venues.
The league is divided into regular season and playoffs, with players between the ages of U6 and U18, and is organized into competition and selection groups, attracting nearly 3,600 players from the city's 256 national teams.
After more than ten years of development, the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League has become a platform for Beijing youth ice hockey enthusiasts to consult technically and extensively with their friends, and to provide excellent players for Beijing youth ice hockey teams and youth teams.
The league played an important role in stimulating the youth ice hockey in Beijing, fueling the enthusiasm for ice hockey at the Winter Olympics and laying the foundation for the development of ice hockey in Beijing during the post-Winter Olympic period.

A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan an arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gan Dan 'arrow target' for her sister collecting donations" blew up the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan an arrow" written on the board, indicating that pedestrians can use bow and arrow shooting after paying.
The incident sparked controversy among Internet users.
Last night, the head of publicity for the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to reporters in Xinjing that the police confirmed that the girl raised money for her sister to make such an outrageous move, but the behavior is not worth promoting, after warning the girl has left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the Streets "Arrow Target" Fundraising Admonition
In the picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" written on it in black ink, and in front of another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat account, payment treasure account, etc.
The picture sparked controversy after it was posted on the Internet.
Some commentators have called the move “an eye-opening begging act,” and others have expressed sympathy.
“What we found when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd was that there were already a lot of people around.”
In an interview with the local media, police officers at the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stalls, all around 20 years old, dressed up as youthful and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was the "target of human flesh" kept crying, asking passers-by to play the game; the other girl at the side shouted, saying that her friend's sister had leukaemia, now urgently needed surgery, please help.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister’s leukemia treatment.”
Last night, the head of publicity at the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told reporters in Xinjing that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, for her sister Ji Jia Yan collected donations.
But with the treatment still costing more than $300,000, it took a while to come up with a good way to raise money.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target, one responsible for launching, but did not participate in the whole process, no one found an arrow, only someone surrounded and took a photo posted on the microblogging.
After the police were appraised by the security department, the use of bows and arrows did not fall within the scope of regulation.
The person in charge said that “there is no advocacy for this kind of open-ended fundraising.”
After being warned by the police, she left the police station.

Project managers can impact the gold medals of the Olympic GamesThe article is very hot, in which mentions the project managers in many projects, absolutely can be a horse first, no one can be: Move brick, business trip, stay up at night is the project manager's daily life, rescue fire, back boiler, apology is not even under the word.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, represented by the current project management inadequacy.
And the people who are engaged in project management, also gradually choose to take some action to get rid of the difficulties in their work.
As the number of PMP (Internationally Accredited Project Management Professional) applicants increases each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, nearly 600,000 PMP® applicants registered in China, about 420,000 PMP® certified, and about 300,000 valid PMP® holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global total of PMP® holders.
Over the past decade, the number of PMP holders has grown year by year, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that simply copying past "old experience" is no longer desirable, and that the ever-changing work environment lets us know a way to learn, to stand on the shoulders of the scientific giant and explore the way forward.
However, is it possible to ensure smooth project management by taking the PMP exam?
Many beginners in project management say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten areas of project management and the five process groups and other relevant knowledge points.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: lack of understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, cannot land on the job, project estimation is inaccurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is dragging on and on; division of labor among members is not clear, the "old oil strip" in the team does not know how to cope with interdepartmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ......
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management field more than ten decades, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has received the honorable title of "Chinese companies R&D management talent training demonstration base" and so on, China Tianhua summer consultation with the "R&D project manager special training camp" on-line course came.

This year, the amount of transactions in the national network payment business for the "Shanghai Eleven" Carnival reached 1.7 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
On the other hand, consumers have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double 12", JFTC Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "JFTC") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, rejecting blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index stood at 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019.
In general, China's residents perform well in the financial consumption level, but there are big differences in the different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
According to Nielsen's China Youth Liabilities Report and CCTV's China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020, the younger generation has enormous potential for consumption, and credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no accumulated debt. While the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, it differs greatly from the label of "excessive expenditure" affixed by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption, consumption behavior that follows the wind, and consumption behavior that follows the wind
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JFTC has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption outlook, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially among younger groups, through practical actions.
Over the past several years, JFTC has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities aimed at young people, including university students, and conducted various forms of tacit guidance on the consumption needs of young people, such as launching an innovation practice contest in cooperation with top domestic institutions, to help them establish rational consumption concepts and rationally plan consumption needs, thereby helping them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary, JFTC reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, to avoid consumption-borrowing misconceptions, in order to avoid affecting personal credit collection and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned ahead of time, and payable on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, JFE Credit will, as always, with its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, bring more appropriate demand and diversified services to consumers, continuously help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the idea of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a consumer financial partner that can be trusted by consumers for life.

Vietnam People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council faces common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions severely affected Haitian internal unity and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blockaded land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward “solidarity and stability” mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The resolution of differences among the Gulf Arab states and the restoration of relations with Qatar are demands that must be united in the interests of all nations and in the interests of regional stability, in order to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
A 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries’ companies have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
His visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the rest of the world on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear program – an agreement that the Gulf Arab states have condemned for failing to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term “competitor,” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States consider it flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia conducted direct negotiations with Iran against the background that the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran failed to satisfy the aspirations of the Gulf states.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first meeting of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
It is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the restoration of the unity of the Commonwealth, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Nominated New Mountain Area ultra-run exhaust sound is the biggest!
This time our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model — the Aventador LP700-4!
Nearly two million dollars, a year's toll, ten thousand dollars, four-wheel drive, why LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
The data says that 0-100 km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, it is probably the article's myvi to reach 30 km/h when people have to 100 km/h, well.
The low body, the noisy scissors doors, the huge air intakes all around the car and the 6.5 V12 engine overlooking the glass perfectly illustrate Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, just Google oneself, the reporter put together some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
Too much attention, wherever everyone is watching, very uncomfortable!(Actually, a little refreshing)
1km oil money is about RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting up and down, or it'll be a little awkward (because you won't be able to climb the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine sound is too loud, you will be deaf immediately after getting out of the car. (However, it is still very refreshing)
The car body is too big, parked in the ordinary parking lot will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked at the door of the next car!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (the reporter's own story, has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your favorite car, please contact us!

"The Spirit of the University and the Spirit of the Times". www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Spirit of the University and the Spirit of the Times. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of running principles and the pursuit of value accumulated in the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present day, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has assumed a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For our university, it arose in the autumn of national danger, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value idea of "Ming Dynasty Jizei, Shu Qi Jiping" and the patriotism of "developing a strong country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global education competition, technology competition, and talent competition are intensifying. As an important “supply side,” higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Comprehensive Programme for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Subjects" demonstrates our country's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, and at the same time puts forward higher and more up-to-date requirements for university development.
How can we accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class subjects in a relatively short period of time, and achieve the “overtaking of the curve”?
In addition to firm objective self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should give full play to three kinds of advantages: first, a backward advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents overseas, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and realizing a remarkable improvement in academic standards and the quality of running schools; second, a cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated in the five thousand years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture in order to consolidate strength, shape brands, and enhance the image; and third, a institutional advantage, by exerting the institutional superiority of the socialist country, strengthening the objective drive, pooling consensus, and optimizing the allocation of resources, so as to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools
In particular, it should be recognized that the construction of world-class universities is not possible in a thousand schools, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while exerting its advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have a common Chinese characteristic, but also reflect their own unique goals, running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we have focused on highlighting three characteristics in running our schools: firstly, we have highlighted the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, built an integrated environment for the integration of science and education and the integration of schools and enterprises, and formed an ecosystem for entrepreneurial education along the entire chain; secondly, we have highlighted the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoted the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, built an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary interchange, actively nurtured cross-emerging disciplines and landmark cross-cutting achievements; and thirdly, we have highlighted the characteristics of running our schools and social services, conducted in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerated the formation of a pan-Zhejiang system
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the university spirit at all times, so that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the newest system of expression of Zhejiang University’s spirit is composed of the university’s motto, “To seek innovation,” the common values of “ diligence, virtue, discernment, and faithfulness,” and “Hina River, enlightenment, virtue, pioneering people, and our nation.”
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulates a high level of culture and cohesive spiritual strength, and has a rich and far-reaching meaning.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, embodied in the heart of "the world's talents for me to use" and expressed as the quality idea of drawing on the world-famous schools to run and educate people; "Enlightenment and good morality" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that while the university is pursuing the truth, it should be more subject to the ethics and personality sharpening; "open-minded people" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the search for new knowledge, scientific research and innovation, but also expressed as the reform and development, revolution and revolution; "Tree our nation" emphasizes the
This series of spiritual ideas and pursuit of values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history.
“He who is intelligent hears in silence, and he who is wise sees in the invisible.”
It is time for China's universities and colleges to further build on the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp profoundly the historical orientation of higher education and its historical mission, and accelerate its construction to become the world's first-class universities.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic concern and freedom of independence, and let the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation vibrate with each other, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national wealth and strength, national revival, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Iranian President: If sanctions against Iran are lifted, Iranian nuclear negotiations are likely to reach an agreement.
Tehran, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) – Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on December 11 in Tehran that a “good deal” could be reached by negotiating a comprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear issue if US sanctions were lifted.
In a meeting with Iranian ambassadors to neighbouring countries on the same day, Lehi said Iran had demonstrated its willingness to negotiate by submitting proposals to other parties involved in the Iranian nuclear deal, according to the Iranian president's website.

As the NFT exploded, a new concept emerged for the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a major impact in Southeast Asia, as residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-generation game that combines a variety of gameplay elements, including NFT, and is currently the highest-traded NFT project with over $3 billion in revenue.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earned over $8.2 million a day, pushing "Kingdom Glory".
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially said it had over 1 million daily users.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, the player is no longer a single character, but can participate in the governance of the game's ecology in addition to gaining fun and economic returns from the game.
This autonomy is not granted by the game developers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of a friend, my biggest impression is the choice of enterprises in the racetrack, that is, the choice of the industry that refers to the investment target, first of all, to choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of more than 100 billion; secondly, to choose an industry with good growth in the future, considering the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose an industry with policy support.
The wideness of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, the flatness or roughness of the track refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy is to do the things right.
The strategy is to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land, above most tactical thinking, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether the current domain is continuously deepening or expanding horizontally (strategic thinking); on how to increase customer retention (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), one can think about how to set the right activity KPI and achieve the right activity objectives, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurate renewal; on how to increase DAU (tactical thinking), one can think about whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in 2021, twelve years after its birth.
On 7 September, the small Central American country of El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as its legal tender, marking the first time that Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin Futures ETF to enter U.S. capital markets and a further expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

More than 130 Asian groups in the U.S. filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23 to protest the discriminatory admissions practices of Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Educational Union, which brought the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of the top U.S. universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in the top three U.S. universities remains essentially the same, the group's chairman, Zhao Yuqing, said at the conference.
Many studies have shown that these institutions “continuously and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “comprehensive consideration” admissions process.
A 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed Asians had the lowest admission rates among all ethnic groups in the three universities, Zhao said.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest enrolment ratios for Asian students, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice would be able to conduct an investigation and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after establishing the facts.
They also hoped that the complained universities would take the issue seriously and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, three universities have not responded to the complaint.
The Association for Asian Education, founded in 2015, filed a complaint against Harvard University's enrollment discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education denied the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups involved in the complaint, there are also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory in Zhejiang's Yuyao Zhejiang Town, and after several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu made a deposit of 200,000 yuan through a bank transfer on the same day after consulting with Mr. Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, about the details of the purchase of the factory building.
"If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, the two parties agree to sign a contract for the purchase and sale of the factory within a week."
However, the two sides subsequently failed to reach agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale and payment method of the factory building, which led to the delay in signing the contract.
Considering that the two sides could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the $200,000 deposit to Mr. Lu.
It was not easy to see the house, the deposit was paid, and the rent was ready, so he had to sign the contract "at the door," but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court held that the failure of both parties to conclude a formal contract in the end could not be attributed solely to the defendant and should reasonably be deemed to be a failure of consultation.Therefore, the deposit penalty rule should not be applied in this case and the defendant should not be liable for breach of contract by double repayment of the deposit.
After the trial judgement, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second Instance upheld the original verdict.
Counsel reminds you to exercise the necessary due diligence in the course of the transaction.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer must perform the necessary duties of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house has been occupied and other relevant information, and make clear in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract at the same time.
At the end of Friday's "Democracy Summit," China's foreign ministry spokesman said in a speech Saturday (December 11) that the "Democracy Summit of Leaders" was organized by the U.S. "with ideological divisions, the instrumentalization and weaponization of democracy, the practice of pseudo-democracy against the reality of democracy, the incitement of division and confrontation, and the transfer of internal contradictions."
The Chinese government believes, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, carried out 'democratic transformation,' abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a 'color revolution,' with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for US intervention in other countries.
The summit was a step toward fulfilling Biden's campaign promises.
The two-day conference, held on video, was attended by 111 world leaders, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia accused the United States of having problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Doubts have been expressed both internationally and within the United States, for example, by critics of invited leaders, including leaders of authoritarian countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and by some who doubt that the Biden administration's real intention was to organize the summit for geopolitical rather than democratic purposes.
Early German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also attended the video democracy summit
China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that “American democracy is becoming increasingly ill-healthy today, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, party rivalries, political polarization, social divisions, ethnic conflicts, and the division of rich and poor.”
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the shield of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to better withstand the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest,” US President Barack Obama said in a speech.
He emphasizes that democracy is not something that can be taken for granted, “we must continually update it among every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time.”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend them in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The U.S. pledged to launch a one-year, $424.4 billion initiative after the summit to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies before a summit on substantive democracy is scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let us all deliver on our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.

Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the head of the university, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the examination question type, so that the examination really reflects the student's actual level of aspiration.
Indeed, university exams have long been a “hot topic.”
On the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with varying levels of ability, plus varying degrees of study and learning situations.
There are inevitably different feelings when evaluating groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, repetition rates are high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on assaults before the exam. If you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve the effect of doing half as much work.
In this way, “study leftovers” can pass or even get high marks if they don’t spend as much as they should; “study bullies” never drop out of classes, have good homework, good notes, and don’t score as much on exams as they do on the “strange status quo.”
Thus, it seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems existing in the university examination is not without reason, and believe that the situation does not only exist in Lanzhou University.
In this sense, praise should be given to the three students who wrote the letter to Chen.
In fact, everyone who has attended university knows that the phenomenon of hastily preparing for the examination, thinking of various ways to "appropriate" the examination questions from the teacher, striving to delineate the scope of the examination, seeking to get "key guidance" before the examination is not uncommon, even in the examination with a small copy, asking the teacher to raise his hand after the examination is not surprising.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guideline, the measurement of whether a university examination is successful or not lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
When entering the undergraduate stage, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many of the specialized courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge of a subject thoroughly is the content of the university examination.
And the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject, from the point of knowledge, the space of change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher put it, “The basics of university mathematics 20 years ago are still being studied, or the focus.”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not represent a single examination question type, repeated examination questions.
In many universities, examination papers are usually composed of a set of questions, then co-ordinated by senior teachers of the subject, and examination papers are read by all teachers in charge of the subject, so as to overcome the problem of repetition of the examination papers to some extent.
However, to draw up a set of test questions in accordance with teaching and learning practice, the subjects are difficult to present a normal distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, it is also necessary to master the teaching situation comprehensively, comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so as to make the test propositions to the difficulty and the problem type dynamically grasp, can highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, at the same time to the problem type to carry out innovative design.
The examination is the commanding rod of university education, what kind of examination, the students will have the corresponding preparation program, will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The faculty of Lanzhou Jiao University attaches great importance to the student's letter of recommendation and has deployed a reform program throughout the university.
Teaching units shall be required to organize teachers to carry out research and self-examination of course-ending examinations, formulate examination questions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and examination of examination questions and examination links, fine-tune the assessment of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive examination of all links of course teaching.
Of course, it is necessary to put in place a corresponding system, but kung fu is expensive in everyday life, it requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation, eat through both heads, teaching and learning will be better connected, form a benign interaction, the examination will be more in line with the reality, thus allowing "study bully" and "study residue" to get their way.

Special anti-counterfeiting paper for 3,200 newborn babies
(API Newswire) The Sabah National Registry says it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October due to the use of special counterfeit paper stockpiles, affecting an estimated 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Keru Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had been recorded in the system and would be re-issued when the forgery-proof papers arrived next week.
At a press conference, he explained a ten-month-long report by a web-based media outlet on the printing of raw paper for Sabah newspapers.
He said the problem arose two months ago and that Sarawak faces the same problem.
“One reason is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, causing delays in arriving in China.”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah was different from that used in other areas and therefore could not be borrowed from stocks held by other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company for partial printing on the 8th, he said.
“The bureau will be dispatched to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for final printing, estimated to take two more working days (December 20) to deliver to the applicants.”
“We will notify applicants to go to the local branch offices to collect their report cards.”
He added that Sabah had issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From 7 o'clock on until now
Isn't that coming soon?
I'm talking about food.
I'm in front of PRS.

Xinhua News Agency (Beijing Daily, December 11) People's Daily (People's Daily, December 12) Commentator Article: Achieving a Good Start to the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan on Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Central Economic Working Conference
The Central Economic Working Conference, held from December 8 to 10, highly evaluated the achievements of China’s economic and social development over the past year.
At the meeting, the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China delivered an important speech, profoundly summarized the economic work for 2021, analyzed the current economic situation in depth, and made major deployments to the economic work for 2022.
We have solemnly celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially proclaimed China's economic and social development, achieved the first-hundred-year goal of striving for socialism, launched the comprehensive construction of a socialist modernized country, and embarked on a new journey towards the second-hundred-year goal of striving for socialism.
We have convened the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Party to sum up the great achievements and historical experience of the Party's hundred years of struggle, and adopted the Third Historical Resolution on the Great Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Hundred Years of Struggle by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
Over the past year, unprecedented changes in the world and the global epidemic of pneumococcal pneumonia have intertwined, the external environment has become more complicated and severe, and the tasks of prevention and control of pneumococcal pneumonia and economic and social development at home have become extremely demanding and arduous.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which is centered on Comrade Xi Jinping, has insisted on coordinating the two major issues at home and abroad, maintaining the overall tone of steady pursuit of progress, calmly responding to the changing circumstances of the century and the epidemic situation of the century, coordinating epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, strengthening macroeconomic policy adjustment across cycles, focusing on promoting the sustained healthy development of the economy, focusing on deepening reform and opening-up innovation, striving hard to accomplish the arduous tasks of reform and development, and achieving major new achievements in various undertakings of the Party and the state.
An important aspect of the "14th Five-Year Plan" is to build a new development pattern, take a new step and achieve new results in economic and social development.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control have maintained a leading position in the world, and the characteristics of strong resilience, great potential and strong dynamism have continued to emerge; the country's strategic scientific and technological forces have accelerated and strengthened, major innovation achievements have emerged in tandem, the capacity for scientific and technological innovation has continued to be enhanced, and new breakthroughs in key core technologies have been achieved; the resilience of the industrial chain has been enhanced, the quality of foreign trade has increased, the structure has continued to be optimized, and new dynamic energy, represented by new industries and new business patterns, has grown and strengthened; the reform and opening-up process has been advanced in depth, and efforts have been made to plug the bottlenecks that restrict the matching of supply and demand and the flow of elements,
The achievement of these achievements is the result of the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the result of the scientific guidance of the Chinese People's Political Declaration and Strategy, and the result of the combined efforts and hard work of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party.
Practice has once again proved that the Party has established the core of the Party Central Committee of Comrade Xi Jinping and the core of the entire Party, and has established the guiding position for the development of the Chinese Communist Party and its undertakings in a new era, which is of decisive significance to the development of the Party and its undertakings in a new era and to the historical process of promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With the President-in-Office of the Communist Party of China as the core of the CPC Central Committee, the leadership of the entire Party, the scientific guidance for the development of the Chinese Communist Party, and the unity and tenacity of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party, we will surely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles and create a new era of splendour and a new historical great achievement on the new quest of building a socialist and modernized country in an all-round manner.
The 20th Party Congress will be convened next year, which is an important event in the political life of the Party and the country.
To carry forward the great spirit of the founding Party, to adhere to the overall tone of the work of steady progress, to fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development philosophy, to accelerate the construction of the new development pattern, to open up the reform process of economic development, to adhere to innovation-driven development, to promote the development of economic development, to adhere to supply-side structural reform as the main line, to coordinate epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, to coordinate development and security, to continue to do well in the "six-steady" and "six-guarantee" work, to continuously improve people's livelihoods, to work hard to stabilize the macroeconomic system, to keep the economy operating within a reasonable range, and to keep the social situation stable, we will surely be able to maintain a stable and healthy
Let us unite more closely around the Central Committee, which is centered around Comrade Xi Jinping, strengthen the “Four Consciousnesses,” firmly uphold the “Four Self-confidence,” achieve the “Two Maintenance,” constantly improve our political judgment, political understanding, and political execution, implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Committee in practice, and push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in a new era.

Educational Information: Beijing compressed the proportion of students with special needs enrolled in primary and secondary schools at the beginning of 2016.
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of specialized students enrolled in Beijing junior high school was carried out by the unified organization of the faculty committees of each district.
This year, Beijing's districts have reduced the enrollment ratio of special-needs students, and the competition for special-needs students has become more intense.
Taking the Dongcheng District as an example, this year the enrollment rate of primary and junior high school specialized students in the district as a whole does not exceed 5% of the enrollment rate of the entire district, the planned enrollment number is 380 people, and the enrollment rate does not exceed 10% of the school enrollment rate.
All students who have specialized in sports, art, science and technology and register on-line are eligible to participate in the Admissions Examination for Specialized Students.
To make it easier for students to participate in the examination, Dongcheng City extended last year's examination arrangement by setting up one or two examination sites in each school district, for a total of 13 examination sites.
On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points in different examination areas to conduct the examination.
On May 23, the District Education Admissions and Examination Center announced the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can check the results of the examination online.

48 hours nucleic acid negative, set "buffer zone" State Council Joint Defense Joint Control Mechanism issued a statement requesting to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control
Xinhua News Agency (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiansheng) said on December 11 that the State Council's Joint Defense and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the control and prevention of pneumonia outbreaks in port cities, requiring people who recently leave land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold negative certificates for testing nucleic acid within 48 hours and carry out at least one test of nucleic acid after arriving at land border port cities.
According to the notification, the time scope of the above-mentioned requirement shall be from the date on which the port city scope is determined and announced by the provinces and municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the Notice also states that conditional port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
For some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides frequently visit each other, the head of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the State Health Commission said.
By implementing a policy of differentiated management of sub-divisions, from one line of outbreak prevention and control to two lines of prevention and control, it is hoped that the frontier will be moved forward, the risk of outbreak prevention and control will be reduced, and maximum effectiveness in outbreak prevention and control will be achieved at the lowest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many cases of indigenous aggregation epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice points out that this exposes the following problems: inadequate early warning and monitoring of local epidemics, inadequate implementation of closed-circuit management by high-risk personnel, regular flow of nucleic acid testing, inadequate killing of cold chain items, inappropriate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and accurate emergency management of epidemics.
According to the notification, nine aspects such as improving the mechanism for preventing and controlling epidemics in port cities, improving the system for monitoring and early warning of epidemics, and implementing border control measures will be pursued.
The Notice emphasizes that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control as well as work on the protection of the people's livelihood, announce and open the hotline for the protection of the people's livelihood, regularly check the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic necessities of life, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the people.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where the open land, water and air ports are located, the cities (territories, states, unions) where they are located and the cities directly under the Central Government.

"Twenty Years of U.S. Bloodshed".
(video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "The Killing Machine" was released on the oil pipeline platform, attracting widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan War under the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exported American-style democracy through war, spent 20 years in the hands of poor soldiers, committed crimes against humanity such as bloodlust, murdering innocent people, and committing crimes against humanity.
Abuse of unmanned aerial vehicles in civilian areas such as hospitals and schools, distortion of humanity, and formation of killing groups.
Over the past two decades, US troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The Americans set up a "black prison" to inflict torture and humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity incites hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terror” war is “more anti-terror than terror.”
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless massacres.
Poke the video, let's uncover the truth of America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism," poke the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from a commercial point of view and from the point of view of preservation period, why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with the canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the scope of operation of the bonded logistics company, here is the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder factories, contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials in the bags and the milk powder are the same, no difference at all.
Then you will surely ask: Why is the warranty period of the bag is one year, and the warranty period of the listening package is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is there such a big difference between the price of hearing aids and bags?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers think that it is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mindset eaten after the reaction also said that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why it sounds expensive. Where is it?
Why is the price differential so high when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers pricing take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or no profits, what can the manufacturers survive on?
So they have a big rise in the price of listening to guarantee their profit margin.
As a result, most manufacturers prefer hearing aids rather than bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, what's the cost?
You can imagine it.
With the development of society, the expenses of marketing, such as promotional personnel, display expenses, product gift expenses, advertising expenses, etc., are constantly increasing.
So the manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and are listening to, the price of which is also constantly rising, in fact, it is new products with the increase in market expenses.
The main aim is to get higher profits, in fact, the cost of increasing their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, by all means, hook up with hospital doctors, by which they help to promote the products, from a listening profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's laws do not allow such practices, which are harmful to consumers.
It is advisable to buy packed milk powder in cans on the premise that you have a can at home, so that you can save money, and increase the preservation and sealability of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of the listening package is longer than that of the bag, if the shelf life of the listening package after opening the bag and the shelf life of the bag is the same, just say that the bag is not easy to store after opening the bag, susceptible to moisture deterioration.

"Don't scare people on the runway".
When you go to the bookstore, you can often feel the explosion of success-oriented books.
Many of today’s success books advocate “best principles” – that is, assuming or implying that you can “do it,” and then telling you “what” you need to do.
It's like saying that we've gone beyond the "how to do" part of the process, which is actually the most important and fundamental part.
That’s why these books have one thing in common: either you do the best you can, or you just don’t do anything; either you’re 100, or you’re 0; or you’re climbing Mount Tai, or you’re just staying where you are.
This “best principle” is recognized as “excellently correct” by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people are scared to death in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “making up your mind, reinventing yourself, coming to a 180-degree transformation,” which is precisely the fatal weakness of many.
To a man who abides by the rules, obeys the old, and refuses to change, you must yell in his ear, “You must change,” and it is certainly self-deceiving, like playing the ox’s harp.
The overwhelming majority of people will shy away from the word "transformation" and struggle to make up their minds. Or, with a momentary impulse, they will make up their minds to "transform," and bravely take the first step.
The echo of Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow onwards" is the most iconic expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the “best principles” is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people’s abilities, for the vast majority of people to “look up and sigh.”
Perhaps the “second best” principle is the only way to get more ordinary people onto the path to relative success.
At the heart of the “second-best principle” is “reducing the threshold” – which encourages a “win-win-win” theory, i.e., if you can’t do 100, you can only do one: because one is always greater than zero; if you can’t climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the little sand dunes at your doorstep, because that’s always better than walking.
Anyway, if you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there is much more chance for ordinary people to stick to it, and the probability of success increases as long as they stick to it.
The road to success simply follows the “second best” principle, and is a little longer.
In short, the “best principle,” while ostensibly a banner of success for all, can ultimately inspire, in fact, only a few; and the “second-best principle,” can effectively inspire more people, benefiting as many as possible.

The amount of raw carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year.
Xinhua news agency reported by wire in Xining on December 11 (reporters Lock Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons, more than 40 times the cumulative increase compared to the initial protection in 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, popularly known as Huang Yu, is a unique species of precious fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the water-fish-bird ecosystem and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to factors such as large-scale human kills and the increasingly degraded environment in the naked carp breeding waters.
In 2004, the naked carp of Lake Qinghai was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented sealed-off fish farming, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals to fish for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through measures such as artificially breeding and releasing the carp, clearing the main inflow channels into the lake, and designing scientifically reasonable fish passageways.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that so far, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake has been artificially propagated and released nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
Qinghai-Sanjiang source area is an important ecological barrier and water reservoir area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai-Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment in the source area of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year Qinghai has successively issued Notices of Prohibition of Catching in the Key Waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag because the weather was cold
I'd like to ask, is it packed in a bag?
We only saw one bag
I'd like to know if it's a leak or if someone took it from us,thanks
It's been an hour. It hasn't been delivered yet.
I just saw an article about taking a break. It's too long.
For men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause occurs around the age of 50.
Subsequently, the prerequisite for good health is a regular visit to the clinic every month.
But it is also not regular enough to be able to accurately predict, about a week's tolerance, need to prepare ahead of time, sometimes bad luck will turn (suddenly a few days ahead of time).
The length of time, the amount of blood and the degree of gout vary from person to person, some people have three days, some people have a week; some people have little flow, some people have a big hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, some people have pain that an ambulance takes away, gout will change over time.
The menstrual cycle is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is use a towel or sanitary pad to suck the blood and prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Painful menstruation is mainly because of the secretion of progesterone, when the menstrual period has not yet arrived at the beginning of the physiological period to quickly take ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain during the month, it is no use to eat after the beginning of the menstrual period.
Before the period of physiology because of uterine congestion and too much release of progesterone, easy to pull the stomach.
If it comes to the cycle, mysterious belly, basically in two days will come menstruation.
Towels are best changed once every two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to bacterial growth. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case scenario is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 tablets.
(Change here. You don't have to change the sanitary pads all the time. You can change them once every five or six hours, for a maximum of eight hours.)
Menstrual hormones can be irritating, and ovulation can be emotionally unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is unfortunate, the body tries to hinder itself.
But official crime figures show that women’s ability to control their emotions is still high, and that emotional problems are not an excuse.
It's not just blood that's flowing, it's the uterus that's falling apart.
The inner membrane of the uterus is thinest at the end of menstruation, and then slowly thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, and every month a house is built (the inner membrane thickens) to welcome guests, guests do not come, all are removed (menstrual discharge) next month a new house is built, and the week begins again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, bleeding for several decades, every few days 24 hours, but also abdominal pain and back pain, who wants?
But a man can be born because his mother has had a menstrual period, and the menstrual period is to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, and everyone should thank their mother for having a regular and healthy menstrual period.
In the past, a lot of women's things were suppressed, society gave women brainwashing is said to be dirty, shameful, everyone thought that is so, but the times have changed.
If someone feels menstrual nausea, feels that the woman's body is preparing for the birth of life nausea, shouldn't it be said in public, girls stand up, don't think about it again, have never experienced it, will never experience it, and don't know much about men, don't be so ungrateful I don't know what kind of attitude, how nice it is to face your mother, how nice it is to want your child?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary pads. They're really useful.
Today is the winter solstice. It's disappointing to make mistakes
Order another meal for the little ones
I hope the store will check the listings in all its busyness
Foot bath basin foam foot hair is electricity leakage?
Choosing a suitable foot bathtub can play a good role in foot therapy health care. Today's article will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the increase of people's health consciousness, foot baths are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of different grades of products are emerging in the market, ranging from hundreds of thousands to thousands of yuan of foot baths, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tubs and other health-related household appliances sold explosively, but foot bath tubs do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to dip your feet in the electric water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a bathtub for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numb when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bathtub, but did not think to turn off the vibration function, the father still felt a numbness in the bottom of the foot.
Mr. Li tried the pen and the pen was lit. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath had electricity.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good, but Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable despite having thrown away the footbath.
He found that the long-established footbath does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation for setting the maximum temperature, what kind of people it should be used for, what materials it should be made of, and so on.
But in general, footbath basins do not have electricity problems, but also exclude a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split-shaped foot bath tub.
Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazards.
Meanwhile, you can take a pencil test at will.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - 视点头条 - 湖南日报网 - 华声在线
(Photographed by Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo cum New Red Tea Promotion will be held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the pursuit of the goal of achieving a billion-billion-dollar tea industry.
The opening ceremony was attended by Hou Shun, Deputy Chairman of the General Council of the China National Federation of Marketing Cooperation, and Ye Hong, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the novelization of the source of lake red and the rise of red tea to inject new impetus into the "Five Colored Xiangcha".
In recent years, the provincial and provincial governments have strongly supported the development of tea industry, pushed forward the construction of a billion-dollar Xiangshan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Xiangshan four-water five-color tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main types of tea such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have been rotated, and the main producing tea districts have promoted the integration of tea trips, which has led to increased yields for the vast majority of tea farmers.
The feng shui rotates, and the red tea increases its power.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that once the green tea was harvested, the red tea and black tea were harvested, and tea farmers earned income all year round, and the value of tea gardens rose steeply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership awarded licenses to the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark.
At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high-mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, was pleased to say that the current epidemic and other factors affected the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but from the scene of the tea fair, bright spots appeared.
The modernization of red tea infused with the connotation of tea culture, people's prosperity, trade fire, Xiangshan tea industry welcomed the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up because there's no parking downstairs
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.

Metaphysical branches include ontology, natural theology, and extensional questions.
In essence, ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns merely represent a concept."

It investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, and contributes to all the moral factors that contribute to such choices, examining the ethical views held by social groups.

He was born in the year of the sheep, in the month of the sheep, on the grass of the sheep's pasture, and was known as Jiangbo (Chinese: 羊行; pinyin: Jiāngbo; literally: "sheep's pasture"; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Chinese: 羊行; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Hebrew: 羊行; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Hebrew: 羊行; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Hebrew: 羊行; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Hebrew: 羊行; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Hebrew: 羊行; literally: "sheep's pasture"; Hebrew: 羊行; literally: "sheep'
He is known as a "suspicious genius" in the industry for his publications such as "Thailand Stories," "India Stories," "Japan Stories," and "Korea Stories" in the "Diverse Code" series.

"Welcome to Friends".
I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than thirty years since the death of our relatives, and especially for the uninterrupted assistance I have extended to my friends at home and abroad in my personal capacity since the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to become household workers.
Your acts of kindness have helped us, these afflicted families, through the most difficult times.
The new cholera epidemic is now sweeping the globe, and most donors have retired by the end of the year.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian contributions of the Mothers of Tiananmen, who are so dear to our hearts. This humanitarian relief effort should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of Scholars of American Studies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in providing humanitarian aid.
In the course of humanitarian relief efforts, NAACP and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often crossing each other.
(Apple Daily photo: Tian'anmen Mother's website is managed by Toyo.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds are often not delivered smoothly into the hands of those in difficulty.
In 1994, Mr. Keating suggested that a special group be set up by the Mother of Tian'anmen to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the Sixty-Four Orphans Education Fund, which has been in operation for 11 years, and in 2009, after all the Sixty-Four Orphans graduated from university, MCDF subsequently established the Sixty-Four Orphans Relief Fund, which is still in operation today.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and community donations in 1964, generous contributions from individuals, and support from the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the members of the Sixty-four finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of the Sixty-four.
During this period, Human Rights China also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's donation is for the benefit of the donors. We are all retired people, and our incomes are not as good as they were before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude for Mr. Ding's letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the dependants to terminate this project within two years and to resume it immediately if necessary.
At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those comrades who have persisted for many years in offering generous donations and risking their lives to provide humanitarian aid.

No matter from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to the later stages are indisputable.
The make-up artist is specially delicate, will match according to your style to suit your make-up, cosmetics are also a line of big brands.
Needless to say, photography is quite a profession.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and two little cats accompany play.
We work in Beijing, Beijing's better movie theaters all need to line up half a year in advance, co-workers have shot in Beijing, watching the next movie feels just so so.
I specifically sought out this studio, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, I think this is also a short version of most people, photographer Liang brother will capture, record naturally wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production designer, a fine team.
We and the people around us couldn't help but applaud.
She had already recommended her past, and she had just seen the film and was equally delighted.

The restaurant clerk is calling me now
A programming wizard who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it's best to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you are going to go to the pit in this industry training really is a very good choice, especially for those who are self-restraint and weakness, training is a very good choice.
If your self-control is stronger, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the faculty strength of the institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institution is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before selecting a training institution, it is best to explore the students who come out of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, whether the course is good or bad.
Hi, actually I don't know how to answer the question you asked, because there is no definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you're in, all have to do with the industry you're studying or wanting to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have graduated from the computer major, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the most efficient and the lowest cost. Nowadays, many online training organizations online are actually very good, but one study cost is high, two invest more time, basically need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I say these situations, self-study is convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to b station also have a lot of training resources, if you do not find the resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation is also possible.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then it is advisable to go to training institutions to study, so that the study does not take much effort, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and people specialized in answering, in addition to the study planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, after study recommend to the company, so that the job interview later can also save a lot of things.
If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me for further information.
I said 1 o'clock. I saw it on the app.

A lot of times, it's not your ability that's holding you back, it's the courage to face things positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you confront difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
"Saudi Arabia's First Biennial of Contemporary Art".
Saudi Arabia's first biennial exhibition of contemporary art The Riyadh Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art was officially opened to the public on December 11 at the Riyadh JAX Art Zone in northwestern Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participating.
This biennial exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Dili Biennial Exhibition Foundation and UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Center of China, with Feiyu Tian, curator of UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Center of China, as artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the biennial exhibition is “Touching the stone across the river,” a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socioeconomic transition, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This two-year exhibition occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Touching the stone across the river", "Inheritance as an experiment", "Border thinking", "Towards the public", "Beautiful new world" and "On the spirit of art".
Among them, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of works in the exhibition, including paintings, installation art, and performing arts; 12 Chinese artists were also attracting attention, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's 2014 reconstruction of a classic landscape painting with waste materials.
"We hope this biennial exhibition will build international dialogue, give global audiences an opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction," said Mr. Barkley, chief executive of the Didier Biennial Foundation.
“The aim of the biennial exhibition is twofold: to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art,” Fei said.
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the closing ceremony of the biennial, with artists, policymakers and opinion leaders from the creative industries discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordination and standardization of rural public welfare posts management - Zhejiang website
Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency) in Kunming, December 12, by wire (journalist Lin Beifeng) In order to continuously improve the employment assistance for people who have been lifted out of poverty and consolidate the achievements of expanding the fight against poverty, Yunnan province has recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization and the management of rural public welfare jobs, helping to promote rural revitalization in a comprehensive manner.
At present, a total of 44,830,000 rural public welfare posts are being developed in Yunnan, which will be used for the employment of rural disadvantaged groups, such as the labor force that has been lifted out of poverty, and will play an important role in helping the people who have been lifted out of poverty to achieve increased employment and income, consolidate the achievements in combating poverty, and effectively enhance the ability of the villages to provide various public services, the relevant head of the Yunnan Ministry of Social Welfare said.
The new regulations will be issued jointly by the seven departments of Yunnan People's Association, Village Revitalization, and Finance, and will mainly standardize the scope of recruitment of rural public welfare posts at the grass-roots level, the management of funds, the development of posts, and the management of posts.
In the area of job development and establishment, the new rules are clear, and the establishment is carried out in accordance with the principles of "deployment on demand, assignment to posts, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses and who is responsible" and "one person per post, voluntary openness and unified management".
The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with the following steps: announcement, declaration, examination, public announcement, hiring, pre-employment training and appointment.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare posts shall purchase commercial insurance against accidental injury for the settlers of rural public welfare posts, and require the relevant departments to monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts on a regular basis.

Although the right wing has had a period of aspiration in history, it is not long, so it is short because giving a little sunshine will make you shine, drinking a little water will make you sweat; a little aspiration will make you look long into Shu, and if you are attacked, you will lose your hair.
In reality, however, the Right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standards of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I am very concerned about his remarks and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that revolution is unnecessary, and that revolution inevitably leads to social instability, damage to people's livelihoods, and political groups are in a muddy mess, and foreign countries take advantage of it.
To change or improve China requires patience and an attitude of responsibility for the country and its citizens. Political speculators are not right-wingers, they are bastards.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party listens to some of the right's speeches and analyzes their ideas when necessary, then the left has no such creation, because what the left wants is the junk the Communist Party has thrown away!
I don't think it's necessary to make a big fuss about the fact that I've recently seen some friends beating up the thieves and beating up the leftists.
Don't try to reason with adulterers and left-wingers. They're all one-sided and irrational.
Don't try to prove that we're right, and don't even try to get the thieves and the lunatics to admit it.
This is how I tell my friends: When an anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, when a left-wing lunatic scolds your right-wing dog, it proves that our middle path is the right one!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but when they grow old, they forget them, or pursue them, and become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually moves farther and farther, even the dragon slaughter juvenile finally becomes the evil dragon.
Left and Right I think generally refers to constraints and freedom, China from the congenital genes of historical culture leads China as a whole should be left-leaning.
At home, the right favours freedom, focuses on efficiency and development, the left favours stronger regulation, and the right favours fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, while the conflict between China and the United States, the left-wing is certain, is estimated to last for many years.
I can't understand it, but the compliments are done
I didn't say anything, the flowers were so brave
For the past two years, America’s blockade and siege of Huawei’s chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but has also caused huge losses for “American” companies.
As a direct consequence, the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in reduced R&D expenditure and lower capacity of chip producers, thereby creating a disorderly shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
The “core shortage” has now spread to major industries around the world, such as car manufacturers shutting down production and rising mobile phone prices, affecting almost all industries that use chips.
In an effort to gain autonomy for “chips,” tech giants in more and more countries are moving toward “de-embellishment.”
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the U.S. has recently repeatedly hosted the "chip summit" and invited 64-nation giants to form a semiconductor alliance and raise funds to support U.S.-based technology giants, such as the U.S.-based tech giant Intel, which has spent $20 billion in the U.S. state of Arizona to build two crystal processing plants and open up its chip subcontracting business in order to regain its dominance in the chip sector.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the power plant, it was likely to take away the power plant's "job".
This is because, as America’s old tech giant, Intel, which has worked in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large pool of talent and technological reserves, is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TPP.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of积电, did not give a damn.
At the "2021 Masters' Think Tank Forum" held in April of this year, Zhang's words were astonishing, and he said bluntly that he had no qualms about the move to bribe Intel to build a chip replacement factory: "It's quite ironic that Intel is building a chip replacement factory."
Zhang's disdain for Intel's encroachment on the crystalline realm stems from Zhang's bitterness over a dispute with Intel over more than thirty years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of America's manufacturing industry, occupying the world's foremost position, and the world's hegemonic semiconductor giant.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which chips were designed, manufactured, and sealed in a single factory.
However, such a model is overwhelming for some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face enormous production line construction costs that they can only hope to avoid.
In 1984, when Zhang heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it would be possible to establish a factory specializing in the manufacture of crystals.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and Taiwan's accumulated electricity system was born.
The company's main business is focused on the single segment of "crystal processing," which does not involve design, but only provides on-the-job services for the manufacture of crystals.
At that time, the newly founded MP3 player, in front of the giant Intel is small.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought to invest in Intel, but at the time Intel heard that Tai Po was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, obviously some self-esteem very high, disdain Tai Po, resolutely refused to invest in Tai Po.
Zhang Zhongmou also concluded that Intel at the time disliked the service.
I didn't expect to despise the giants of crystal manufacturing services in the past, but now also begin to work as a crystal worker.
Consequently, Zhang Zhongmou found it ironic that Intel entered the Crystal Circle.
Today, the market value of TEV has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of the strong attack of Taiwanese accumulated electricity, Intel naturally also did not dare to firmly defend itself.
Today, the tidal current is already thrusting toward the 3 nm chip, while Intel remains at the 14 nm level seven years ago.
To catch up is not easy.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
By 7:06 p.m., it's been 2 hours since I ordered.
Let's look at some [strange searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hotspots were randomly selected: the February 2 rise, the rise in the price of goods, the commodity rally, the spread of public opinion formed a wave peak, then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, and if there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump peak again.
They appear to be no different from the evolutionary model of Internet public opinion that has been presented on the official website of the Internet Correspondence Bureau.
What is abnormal public opinion?
A random selection of six hotspots in the same event yields [lonely peak-shaped], [ serrated-shaped], and [cliff-shaped].
There are three types of hotspots: cyclic hotspots, where the topic is on the hotspot list, and cliffs, where the hotspot performs its "function" and receives new tasks and heads off to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the wave valley of another event, the time is no less than a second, it must be the united battalion of sailors received the task of launching a new offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches simultaneously appear on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for popular science, which leads to war, which diverts attention, which influences cognition, which misleads judgement, which inflames emotions, which entangles decision-making, black accounts batch by batch, subsection by subsection fine-tuning operations, almost taking into account all the elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to retreat.
Anyone who passes by must leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new crown mutant Omicron virus, Xinhua reported.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron poisoning for the first time on October 10.
One infected person was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on 27 November, and another was a Mauritian resident who tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa, according to Malawian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal.
After hospital isolation treatment, both infected patients turned negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on October 10 that it had confirmed for the first time three cases of Omicron poisoning in the country.
All three of them were students who had returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. All of them were mildly ill and had not been admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron poisoning, the Seychelles government has steadily increased its efforts to prevent and control it.
From December 6 to January 10, passengers over the age of 12 travelling by air will be required to have their nucleic acid tested at the airport at their own expense.
The ministry also announced on October 10 that it would start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the new Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Konbise Chibanda, said on Sunday that the country had first detected three cases of Omicron poisoning.
The country's health ministry conducted genome sequencing of 12 new crown-positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three cases of infection.

At first it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I decided to look at it. At first my budget was 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
When he arrives at the store, he starts a series of scams.
The first time I went to the store I just showed them my profile, they didn't actually measure the house, they were able to quote me that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, roughly gave me a look at their materials and did not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you get to the store they'll drag you to pay the deposit (and once you've paid the deposit you'll never be able to withdraw unless you've had enough of a theoretical battle with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called managers to tell you how much we can give you today if you just pay the deposit.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being deceived, in the impulse of the mind, pay more than 10,000 deposits.
The quotation he gave me had a lot of problems 70,000 not including plumbing and electrical alterations, not including any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, and these three were the bulk of the cost of the basement.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and didn't say anything clearly at first and asked me to sign the contract.
When I ask them for a refund, they seem to be very experienced and have a small team of specialists to deal with you.
Either way it's the customer's problem They're completely irresponsible.
Various responsibilities, there are many details, do not want to say all of them are tears, in any case, do not choose them, because my friends are looking for them to renovate the house is also poor quality, the later you calculate various expenses.

There are about ~ Gemini meteor showers on the 14th will usher in a great - wikipedia
As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14, and friends who like it will be able to observe it at midnight later that day, Xinhua news agency said.
A meteor shower in the constellation Gemini was photographed in Qinghai on December 13, 2018 by Beijing astronomer An Jiu.
Most of the meteor shower's parent bodies are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is Phoebus 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known not to have been "borne" by a comet.
Shu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on the science of astronomy, said the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, just like the Happy New Year movie, and the "screening period" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its high flow rate and stability, and together with the quadrangle meteor shower and the Persei meteor shower, it is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of Gemini meteor showers is the slow velocity, rich color, and abundance of Martian meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography by beginners.
Tianjin City astronomer Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin Jizhou.
Astronomers predict that this year's Gemini meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is just above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions).
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
"Last year's brilliant Gemini meteor shower left a lasting impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight and the spectacularity will be reduced a little.
The 14th day of the lunar calendar is November 11, the phase of the moon is convex, bright moonlight can interfere with the observation, well in the middle of the night the moon will fall, at this time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower also rises relatively high.
Friends who enjoy meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but watch out for cold and heat.”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside you can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, an open view to the northeast, and then wait patiently after the moon has set for visual observation.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor showers in all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to look at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor showers while observing.
If you like photography and want to shoot a beautiful ' meteor shower ', it is best to choose a wide angle, large aperture lens, use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential for stability and sustainability.”
Shu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and conventional TV in terms of market positioning?
There are two main differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of their market positioning. One is that the latter is more expensive than the former, while the former is cheaper than the former. The other is that the latter is more expensive than the former.
First, laser television focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the full-fledged market positioning of LCD TV, the laser TV clearly focuses more on the large-screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product born of the large-screen.
Currently, most mainstream LCD TVs are between 55 and 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are typically over 75 inches in size, and the largest is over 100 inches, sufficiently satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the share of laser television in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140 percent in 2020 and will continue to grow at a rapid pace.
The reason why the big screen market has achieved such good results is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye care.
Based on the imaging principle of the diffuse reflection of the laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly hit the eye, compared with the back light source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is less.
An ophthalmologist at the Sixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and an ophthalmologist at the Beijing Commonwealth Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data from a rigorous comparison of laser and LCD televisions viewed under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser television does have strong eye-protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser television not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
In contrast to the steady decline in the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs on the market today is mostly in the tens of thousands of yuan or more, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
I'm sure it makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not realize.
Due to the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser television is shorter than that of conventional projection equipment, can realize a large screen experience of 100 inches within a short distance, requires little space, and the mainframe is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser televisions can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
Additionally, the heat output is lower, equipment losses are reduced, and the lifespan of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a question of false demand, but of the products of demand subdivision, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser TV is not the dish of the A.V. player, wanting to take into account both the large screen and the inadequate viewing environment, can try, everything is advantageous and disadvantageous, after weighing and judging themselves, is afraid to listen to the word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle close-up projector, the laser television, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to attach to the screen, which was not compatible with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a fine-structured fennel curtain is costly, and the 80-inch price is essentially equivalent to a 65-inch LCD.
One more thing, I especially hate projector manufacturers take diffuse reflection good for the eyes this kind of selling point, please, the light that the eyes can see on the curtain is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes can not see, but the real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct light", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Furthermore, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it will not be able to form an image at all.
It is precisely by neglecting the thermal spotting (spotting) effect of high-yield screens, that a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, that it is truly unpleasant.
Fine Art Photography and Visual Aesthetics Studio Quality Shop There is no branch for the time being
Added WeChat appointment date, little sister will send me the optional time schedule, reply information is more timely ~
Before going to see the filming works in the store, more outdoor wedding dresses, shot very beautiful, there are a lot of shooting styles involved.
After arriving on the day, I simply exchanged my thoughts with my little sister, very patiently helped me try out two styles of clothes that I struggled with, finally decided to start make-up modeling ~ the photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and refine each detail more thoroughly.
But maybe it's not the style I wanted it to be because I didn't share any specific shooting ideas with him, but it's supposed to be great.
After shooting, the photographer will help you select photos, communicate post-production style, feel very careful.
The repaired film takes about half a month, sitting and so on ~
The second was a photo-themed hegemonic dinner event—most of the dresses on the set could be chosen to be shot one at a time.
In the end, she chose a black dress and experimented with different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, make-up + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother after 95, it feels a little or a little blue, I hope to be able to give more advice on customer shooting action instruction in the future ~ quite talkative, the shooting process is more pleasant.
Wen Jian Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Selected Quality Store Reply
It's the top page. Let's take a look at queenie too~
Go to the store first fill in the name phone and then choose clothes, wedding dresses can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothes is still quite patient, after choosing makeup for a long time, the service attitude is also good, after the shooting will teach you how to put on the look, just shot the feeling of the face is great, master said it is half a month, three or four days to come out, it feels like there is no difference from the original film
[Environment] The overall condition is good.
There's a lot of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three make-up locations, and there's a photo booth inside.
[Service] Very warm and attentive.
The sculptor is very patient.
The photographer will be very careful to teach you how to move.
Unsatisfied, the photographer will also actively propose a reshoot.
[Experience] Maybe the modeling is a little overdone, originally the eyelids were glued out of the triangular skin.
Eyebrows are also shaved, which is a bit awkward for people who don't draw eyebrows on a regular basis.
The photo has been given for ten days, but the P-graph effect is not very satisfactory, the feeling of the eyelids sticking those are still very obvious.
Because I'm not sure what style I want, I tried two sets, and the result was a black dress. My little sister said that this set is more of the Hepburn style
The hairdresser and the make-up artist were both very patient with me and were very satisfied with the results
After I finished my make-up, I started taking pictures, and all the photographers were in control of my posture, and the process was smooth and harmonious.
When I finished filming, I carefully selected four of my favorite films. My younger brother said that the film was made in 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfying.
No reply for 3 days...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
Now I have to pay the shipping fee every time
I'll be exempted and charged my monthly fee once you've done your research, okay?
Buying an umbrella insurance, is it safe?
Umbrella is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
In order to become an insurance brokerage company, it is necessary to meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no significant illegal records in the last three years, the minimum amount of RMB 50 million can be established, and it must have the approval of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very harsh, to sum up is to have the strength, to have the approval of the national authority department of the Banking and Insurance Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders should have a good style, as an insurance broker's umbrella insurance, the insured need not doubt too much whether the umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, no insurance company can achieve.
In this respect, it is good, it is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest and Thai Super Mary 5 serious illness insurance, the claimant and insurer are both Thai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not doubt its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products, because there are fewer operating costs of the business network point, and the cost of the business staff, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the premium pressure of the insured, while at the same time can leverage the insurance leverage to the maximum.
This is still a very good point.
Consider it.
This is especially important because insurance is a very specialized industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, this can lead to a lot of misunderstandings, in health information and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when insuring, feel that they are healthy or compliant, so it is easy to have a lot of hidden risks to settle claims, the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like the umbrella, also an Internet insurance broker platform) very responsibly tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, the unreliable is people, Internet channels have no professional employees, and there are many sales misleading.
These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are easy to avoid, do not tell the policyholders, the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal fee, dozens to 200, etc., many customers withhold a charge for one or two years to buy themselves is not clear.
Thinking it could cost one dollar, the insurance company paid six million (the world lost pie).
To send a mobile phone free of charge, it is the end of the policy number such as 6666,8888 such a special policy number section sent, and if the winning text message is sent, I do not exchange, and no one reminded.
(This is another pitfall for the insurer) to get 60,000 bad health insurance free of charge, it is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial risks, in the event of a real bad health, 60,000 can do nothing, can not solve the problem, later life begins to run bare.
The country has also been hit hard by misleading sales of Internet-based insurance.
So overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the operators.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting off-line products, saving everyone 2000-3000 yuan / year in insurance premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I:Mingya insurance broker, have had 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serve over 1,000 enterprise users, cooperate with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from the customer's requirement, customize the insurance products for the customer, among the insured, for the customer's goods, try my best to obtain the best verification results for the customer, after insuring, do the policy arrangement for the customer, the policy custody, let the customer feel at ease.
Grow up with every client for life.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insurer can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although Internet insurance is not very "ritual" and may not even have printed paper contracts, this does not in any way affect the validity and legality of electronic contracts.
This model is a bit like a typical "telephone sales" plumbing operation, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that follow-up services may not follow.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we think carefully about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services for many years to come?

No problem, remember there's no need to re-order, I've already bought another one, I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help.
From time immemorial, I have opposed all forms of defamation and abuse, and I cannot accept such acts of physical assault.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this scoundrel.
If you don't look at the parties and factions, the first thing you have to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From when you started asking for friends on Facebook, to when you started posting flirtatious posts, to when you tried to post my so-called home address and father's name on social media, I have responded in a non-responsive manner.
You went on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Later, I received a number of comments from friends about your face, a photo of you on a friend's profile, and sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I uploaded the news of the police, you didn't converge at all, but became more and more vociferous.
I don't care what your political background is, no matter what your status, in our society, there is a need for respect between the sexes.
Yes, you can continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think that it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your drawing, or you can continue to make all kinds of offensive statements.
Yeah, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don't want you to judge me, I don'
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let others humiliate her so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said okay, you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Whether at work, in society, in politics, or in business, it is only those who have no basic morals who choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that honesty is inherent in people.
I intercepted a part of the message for everyone to comment on
Your own post shouldn't be faked by anyone
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization
she's smiling.
Vietnam People's Daily - Prime Minister Van Myung-chun attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Enterprise Development Forum
During the 3rd Vietnam National Forum for the Development of Digital Enterprises, two major meetings were held to discuss the topics of digital enterprises and the digital transformation of the country, digital enterprises and the economic recovery and development during and after the cholera epidemic.
Vietnam’s Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Meng-hung, said that in 2021, the number and revenues of digital-technology enterprises in Vietnam would continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10%, despite the persistent outbreak of pneumonia.
In 2021, Vietnam's typical number of digital products will be cultivated, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam, many digital products have gone out of the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been upgraded.
Minister Nguyen called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms. The task of developing these national digital platforms is the national mission.
At the forum, the leaders of various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared their ideas and solutions on mobilizing and pooling all social resources to develop Vietnamese technological enterprises, jointly promoting the digital transformation of the country and economic recovery after the Zhuhui epidemic.
Speaking at the forum, the Prime Minister emphasized that the digital transformation is a must for the world and an objective requirement for development.
The digital transformation has become a global problem, the digital transformation serves the whole people, and therefore the involvement of the whole people is needed.
People and enterprises are the core, subjects, objectives and drivers of the digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the benefit of the people and enterprises.
Mr. Fan emphasized that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit.It needs internal forces as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as the important and breakthrough factors.
At the same time, he believes that the digital transformation needs to drive deep development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of pneumonia outbreaks, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and support the green transition and the development of green energy.
The digital transformation should involve the establishment of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and traditions, and promote the digital transformation in such areas as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The ultimate goal of the digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous.
Premier Fan Mingzheng urged governments, organs and enterprises at all levels to step up leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of the digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for the digital transformation, strengthen state management and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, activeness and initiative.
During the forum, the Prime Minister attended the award ceremony of "Vietnamese Manufacturing" Excellence Digital Product Award 2021 and the opening ceremony of "Vietnamese Manufacturing" Digital Product Exhibition.

The construction and operation of two integrated water-based green service areas along the upper Yangtze River, combining life-support services, production services and administrative services, with the theme of green environmental protection, ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services, and the realization of “one berth, multiple services” for ships in Hong Kong, will make life more efficient and convenient for seafarers sailing on the Yangtze River year-round.
One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. naval arsenal has rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indian region, according to a new satellite image showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
On 9 January, the satellite spotted the U.S. carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabagh Strait, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Strait of Malabar, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first chain of islands in the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects Carl Vinson to deploy to the South China Sea.
This was Carrier Carl Vinson's first deployment with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Sea Eagle cargo aircraft.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln departed from the United States on 3 January.
Lincoln also flew the F-35C Carrier Squadron for the first time, which was part of the 314th Fighter Strike Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to these two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan based in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser HMS Lake Champlain and the missile destroyer HMS Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. Navy's CMV-22B aircraft carrier flew its route to Guam.
One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend, CNN reported.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Analysts say the visit sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
China's Most Powerful Weapons Rarely Visit Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows Yongxiao Island in Nansha Islands, China.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness for war, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indian region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunderbolt submarines in the U.S. Navy are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines have made the Thunderbolt one of the "most important surviving weapons in the nuclear triad", a system that includes well-launched ballistic missiles in the United States and bombers with nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to a friend about the recent 26 per cent drop in the value of Meta and its $251 billion depreciation, Zuckerberg said he was "confronted with unprecedented competition" and why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue is mainly from advertising, now today's profitable advertising company, has its own traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps external to Meta's advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is implemented.
But times have changed.
First, due to changes in Apple's privacy policy, Meta no longer has access to users' data, affecting the effectiveness of ad placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, clearly indicating whether the app allows users to access their information, and most people's normal reaction must be no.
If Google strikes again, the impact on Meta's revenues will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the extent of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is generally known that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, Meta receives at least 10% of its revenue from China, mainly from companies in the maritime sector.
Meta has about a hundred offices in Hong Kong and several large agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an inescapable advertising channel. Most of the money they burned went to Meta.
Interestingly, TT bytes are now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years Meta has made a lot of money from bytes.
All the agencies in the country are helping bytes to Meta there to advertise, Meta Greater China region also performs very well.
I haven't really looked into it lately, but I'm sure it won't be any better than before.
The era of large-scale money laundering by Chinese companies overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels has not gone smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a fall in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don't just look at middle-income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not sufficient.
In order to tell a new story to the market Zuckerberg talked about the original universe.
Meta really should be one of the directions of the future, but it has a longer implementation cycle, and this story shouldn't be enough to support Meta's market capitalization in the next two to three years.
So the next two years are going to be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook, which is so glamorous and makes $100 billion to $200 billion a year. In fact, Facebook is so crisis-ridden that it doesn't have much of a safe haven compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although some of his social software is now more expensive and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., faced with the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has little confidence, subverting between is a blink of an eye.
So Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and continuously looking for new tracks, but I think his track selection is wrong, it is an irreversible path.
