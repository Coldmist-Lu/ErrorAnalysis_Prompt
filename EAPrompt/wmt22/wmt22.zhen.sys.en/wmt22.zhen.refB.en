Is there any means to punish him?
So that such a thing won’t happen again.
Or how long will it take the restaurant to prepare the foods? Could you please ask them for me?
Students played a leading role in the academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, with research achievements of miraculous things - Xinhuanet
Washing with air, judging disease with halitus and seeking for source of haze, a series of academic achievements of miraculous things at the opening ceremony of 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University were honored yesterday evening.
The main researchers of the achievements are students, with research fields covering environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanistic education; students created high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have been awarded at home and abroad.
Biosensor: your family medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, with the size of only a half of that of a smart phone.
“You need only to take a breath, and this set of device can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the air you breathe. ”
According to introduction from Zhang Diming, this set of sensor is connected with a smart phone, and the report of physical conditions will be shown on the smart phone after you take a breath.
Most smart wristband detecting physical conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
However, this set of biosensor can detect chemical elements by utilizing a new material, i.e., graphene, to reflect the physical conditions in a deeper and more accurate way with sharp “smell”.
Smart operating lamp: powerful eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lamps are popular in operating rooms.
This invention was awarded with a golden prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland in this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two postgraduates from School of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in defects of traditional operating lamps, inventing the smart LED operating shadowless lamp.
“Improper early detection and excision of many diseases are related to operating lamps used by doctors. ”
According to Shen Junfei, by taking early inspection of cancers as an example, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues, the tumor cells will still diffuse.
This kind of smart operating lamp has four lamp panels, which strengthen the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of facula, brightness degree, spectrum, color uniformness and shadowless rate at any time according to needs in operation and personal habits.
This kind of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, with favorable feedback.
The invention was awarded with the first prize in National Challenge Cup in last October.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Most people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap or sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his friends invented a set of “hand washing device with air”.
When a person stands on the wash basin of the device, his weight can compress the air and make it spray out.
“It’s just like an inflator.
The compressed air forms flow at the faucet, which is combined with water.
In this way, we can wash hands clean! ”
According to the chromogenic reaction and the germ residue experiment result: the effect of hand washing in this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.
With the driving force of body weight, this device can ensure cleanness degree and save 90% of water, with no energy consumption during the whole process, which is energy saving and environmentally protective.
In the last year, at the 2nd global great challenge summit, this invention was awarded with the only gold award among all the global top famous universities.
Please arrange for a refund to me soon, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund, I don’t want the points, and I will not use it again #PRS_ORG#!
There are bones and spicy pickles, not suitable for children.
If so, please place an order soon.
We don’t have it at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#.
I won’t wait, and I’ll cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote a wrong address.
Can I change the order?
Or can I cancel the order?
Okay, sorry for the inconvenience.
A significant certificate - certificate of first aid
This is one of important skill certificates except for driving license!
Popularization: first aid measures refer to emergency rescue in emergencies, i.e., the first aid conducted before the coming of the ambulance.
As everyone knows, there is certain period before the coming of the ambulance after the happening of the accident, which is the critical time for rescue.
This period is the most important time for first aid.
If we suffer from heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage or respiratory arrest, there are four minutes as the window for our life, the golden four minutes!
So it is very important to know first aid!
When somebody falls down, we can conduct first aid with our professional knowledge, but not doing nothing by only standing there; this helpless feeling really makes people afraid.
“In China, 3 million people die from accidents every year according to official data, and the most dangerous one is known as sudden cardiac arrest.
15% of people of sudden cardiac arrest can be brought back to life in the America.
In the Casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70% or 80% of them can be brought back to life, and the proportion in Shanghai and Beijing is lower than 1%. ”
Said Lu Le, the founder of the First Reaction.
Pinching of philtrum takes no effect at all if a person suffers from sudden cardiac arrest, with no breath or heartbeat.
Artificial respiration and external chest compression are required to bring them back to life.
In my opinion, very few people have this awareness to study first aid knowledge, which is very important once accident happens; therefore, we should learn this skill, so that we can give timely reaction when facing with emergency situations.
We may bring back somebody to life with this skill.
People can apply for the certificate of first aid at the Red Cross Training Center, and I applied for my certificate at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai, and students are offered with a discount.
PS: The last picture shows the objectives to be completed before 25 years ago, and it was several months ago when I added the certificate of first aid into the list; but I actually achieved it!
Then I want to obtain other certificates, for example, a diving certificate; I know a certificate of diving first aid from the Red Book, and the candidates shall have the certificate of first aid; therefore, the certificate of first aid is very important!
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#.
The shrimp dumpling of 13 yuan included only one! ?
I haven’t tried it before.
Why didn’t #NAME# say it clearly?
13 yuan for only one?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed some foods, and you give me only one shrimp dumpling today! ?
I found it valid when I entered the code before.
I’ll tell my conclusion first; Only Fools Rush In is a terrible film, in every sense.
But the film has one bright spot, i.e., the background music.
Terrible films can be divided into many types, including the films make you sleepy in the cinema and the films make you angry after seeing them; Only Fools Rush In is just like monkeys in Mount Emei, which can kindle your fury after you seeing the film.
Han Han is really a talent in insulting film viewers.
The most terrible thing of this film is that it is just like a creature of the Cthulhu school novels, which is nameless, filled with defects.
You may doubt if there is a metaphor implied by the director after you see it; however, you can find it totally a piece of shit after thinking over it.
I’ll introduce some plots that I cannot understand.
The leading actor lived together with his grandma in an island in south China.
His grandma had a wish of seeing snow, and an uncle of the neighbors drove her to see snow in northeast China with a minibus.
An elderly took a minibus to see snow from south China to northeast China? ?
And the leading actor and his father were at ease about it.
Then the whole film tells nothing more about the grandma.
In addition, running a restaurant in a wasted ship, how did the female leading role’s elder brother acquire the business license?
How could a punk on the island close a section of mountain road so easily? ?
A car delivering reinforcing steel bars was parking at roadside, but there was no truck driver anywhere around.
The sense of prop is so obvious.
How did a punk with poor credit record and suspicion of violation of law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn‘t the person call the police when facing with the usurious loan, and the police specially asked if there was a trouble?
An adult who knew how to use smart phone but did not know how to open the door of the hotel with the room card, who was arranged as staying overnight by sitting out of the room because of failure in finding the boss of the hotel?
The film is full of such inexplicable plots; the plots are too ridiculous that I even feel painful when I recall them every time.
In addition to the plots, the purport of the film is even worse; or we can say there is no purport in the film at all, and it is just a monster of stitches.
You may feel that this is a comedy at the beginning of the film; however, 20 minutes later, you may guess it a motivational film; when seeing a half of the film, you may feel it a story film that reflects difficult life of young people living in a town; you don’t know what you see after you finish it, followed by deep self-doubt that why do you see a piece of shit in a cinema during the Spring Festival.
Most people are familiar with the routine of various types of films; for example, if you want to film something about a motorbike, the motivative film + comedy can be adopted, to tell film viewers the way for a talented green hand to go to success.
If you want to film something about love, you just tell the resentment between a young man passionate in driving motorcycle and a waitress.
If you want to reflect the reality, at least there should be nothing contradict with things in the normal world in your plots.
(Such as the character who sang songs after his new motorcycle was just burned played by Yin Zheng); please don’t kindling a headcanon.
I don’t know if it is about the acting skill or the requirements from the director that the female leading actress behaved like a child of 5 years ago since she did not suffer from mental retardation.
There is another point that I cannot understand: why is Han Han keen on adding some plots about traffic collision in his films since he is a racing driver?
Is such a film arranged during the Spring Festival, so as to make film viewers unhappy and angry?

Such as: various types of inspection shafts, gutter inlets, box drains, septic tanks, small-sized structures and wing walls of bridges for drainage and water storage facilities,
The advantage of building inspection shafts by using concrete modules is that the four sides of the modules are of concave groove structures, which are built to form chain locks.
The shearing resistance of the shaft wall is much better than the masonry form of the flat friction of the brickwork.
The modules are of hollow structure, with connected holes vertically and interpenetrated horizontally; the cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed after pouring of the cores of holes, playing the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproof.
The joint bar grooves are equipped for modules vertically and horizontally; the horizontal and vertical joint bars can improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, there is no phenomena such as collapse, sink or water leakage in the inspection shafts and pumping shafts laid with concrete inspection shaft modules, with stable mechanical performance in shaft wall modules, easy operation and standard forming size.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment can automatically control the input and output of the configured data, and the one-key contact crystal display can monitor all the process of mechanical operation, to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis on materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
Single-cylinder and double-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transportation are adopted for the shaft wall module mechanical and hydraulic system.
The independent hydraulic integration station is utilized, to avoid the influences on the hydraulic system caused by vibration of the master, so as to ensure reliability of the operation of the hydraulic system.
In the concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment, the fabric box proceeding box demolds and lifts, and the storage box door closes, and the  supporting plate is transported automatically, all which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce mechanical abrasion and repair.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment is composed by imported computer and appliances, as well as sealing elements and hydraulic element, to ensure stable and reliable comprehensive performance.
The integral steel plate is adopted for the shaft wall module mechanical vibration platform, with no welding points, so that the stuffing box can swing and orient freely, to greatly reduce mechanical abrasion.
It reduces loads of moulds and reinforces vibration; integrated and full synchronization is adopted for vibration of the platform and the moulds, to ensure the vibration effect.
The shaft wall module mechanical exciting machinery and the computer automatically control the vibration range according to the cost performance of raw materials, leading to no abrasion brake; in this way, it extends the service life and reduces the cost.

Doctors of South Africa: Although with strong transmission, most of the patients infected by Omicron are mild cases
According to lots of doctors and medical experts in South Africa, most of the patients infected by Omicron are milder cases, although it has faster transmission speed.
According to report from the Associated Press, with the transmission of Omicron in South Africa, as reported by a physician organization composed by more than 5000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, those similar with flu such as body ache and cough.
According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief inspector of the organizations, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: “Their disease can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after isolation of 10 to 14 days. ”
He said that aged patients or those with health problems were included, who were easier to be caught in severe cases due to infection of the corona virus.
He said, with a comparison, the patients of COVID-19 of the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
Many of them should be hospitalized within only a few days”.
Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of the Omicron new variant in South Africa.
Although some more weeks are needed to collect sufficient evidences; observation and early proof of doctors have provided some clues.
According to the summarization made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID-19 who were hospitalized within latest weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which were a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which was as high as 20% in the cases of early epidemic in South Africa.
By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, director of Africa Institute of Health said: “At present, almost all the traces indicate that this is a relatively mild disease. ”
He also said: “However, it’s the early stage, and we need acquire data of later stage.
In general conditions, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s just two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic. ”
At the same time, scientists all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as the effect of the current vaccine and the therapeutic method at present.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 viral strain all over the whole world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, in which South Africa is the center of the epidemic.
According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng Province in the first week of December were increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases occupied more than 90%.
Thanks to the supporters today, and all the 80 boxes have been given to them!

Review on education: What should we do to rescue abducted children?
As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand on “abduction”, if people can prevent and fight against abduction, to make it no benefit to acquire, such crime will not happy again.
Recently, the platform for emergency release of missing children information developed by the Crackdown on the Abduction of Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has been put into operation.
This is an Internet information platform, which is established for releasing information of missing children, so that the abducted children can be found back in time.
With the name of “reunion”, the App is so warm.
With new technological means, the App has not only “artistic” and full of feelings, but also appropriate, practical and effective information means.
In order to fight against abduction, the first objective is to find out the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.
The judgment and punishment to the criminal suspect is the secondary thing.
With the significance of criminal punishment, there are lots of “major terms” from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before solving a case, the most important thing is the safety of the victim.
There are orders of priority; suspend the discussion on topics with large disputes such as “if death penalty shall be sentenced to suspect of abducting children” before “seeking and rescuing” children; rescuing them is the most urgent thing.
According to the experience in solving such cases, traders in human beings usually run away from the crime location as soon as possible.
Therefore, every more minute indicates more difficulty in seeking and rescuing of children and solving of the case.
In this condition, it is a practical action to establish a platform such as “reunion”, so as to provide an effective method to solve the case and find the children.
After all, “crackdown on the abduction” is a big task in need of the operation of the whole legal system.
The care of “protecting children” shall be implemented in improvement on legislation, judicial safeguard and careful enforcement for fighting against crime, protecting rights and benefits of children and parents.
In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from family to the society.
By taking a common case as an example, parents and the child had a rest in the train station, and the parents found their child lost after they woke up.
It is unpractical to expect that a child of 2 years old can protect himself/herself sufficiently; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least equivalent protection awareness.
The father and the mother can take turns in sleeping, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the elementary approaches for protecting children from being abducted.
Viewing from the other side of crackdown on abduction, the party that purchases the abducted children shall be noticed and punished, too.
Any single illegal behavior is generally one link of a long chain.
According to the Penal Code, in our country, the legal minimum standard for the crime of child abduction is 5 years; suspects with especially serious plots can be sentenced to death penalty, with properties confiscated.
With high minimum standard for the crime and heavy maximum standard, under the trend of the “lightening of punishment”, the crime of child abduction is a crime with relatively heavy sentence.
However, there have been lots of cases of child abduction so far.
It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas and weak legal consciousness in bringing up children.
It is necessary to provide them with legal education.
Strict enforcement of laws is insufficient for effective control of the crime of child abduction.
If the “market” of buying children widely exists, and abductors keep innovating abduction approaches, forming the pattern of “fighting against” law-executors, the crackdown on the abduction will inevitably be of low efficiency.
Therefore, removing outdated ideas and popularizing common legal knowledge contribute to taking a radical cure to child abduction and child buying.

I hope that you can know something about it.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes earlier than the shown time.
Nothing else, thanks.
It is another deliveryman who will deliver it to you.
He has waited for long.
The restaurant always said my order was being processed.
I’ve waited for hours.
Olive oil is divided into five levels of two categories, i.e., the virgin olive oil and the lampante olive oil or refined olive oil, by International Olive OIl Council.
Virgin olive oil is also known as the natural olive oil, which is the grease acquired by cold pressing from fresh olive fruits and removing of foreign things by means of filtration.
Virgin olive oil can be divided into three levels according to acidity:
Extra virgin: is the olive oil of the highest level and the best quality, a pure natural product.
With excellent taste and elegant and pleasant plant flavor, it has the acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine virgin: with a slightly higher acidity of less than 2%, it has pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary virgin: with acceptable taste and flavor, it has the acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil acquired from the refined virgin olive oil with acidity of more than 3.3%, and is also known as the “secondary oil”.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: the refined olive oil and the virgin olive oil with certain proportion are mixed, to blend taste and color, with the acidity less than 1.5%, showing transparent light golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: it is the olive oil acquired by refining the oil extracted from oil residues with the dissolution method.
After reading the classification by levels, you may find that acidity is a very important index.
We know that olive fruits are just like the grapes used for brewing wine, and olive fruits of different types from different producing areas will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best growing areas for olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the best climatic conditions needed for growing of olives such as soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation.
Aside from the Mediterranean costal area, olives can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas in other areas.
The major production areas (the Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are far away in the southern latitude with similar climatic conditions.
Picking time of olives:
March to June each year is the time for olive trees to blossom and bear fruit; July to October each year is the time for olive fruits to grow and mature, and the fruits change from green, red, purple and then dark.
November to February of the next year is the picking season of the fruits (the freshness of olives is especially important).
Nutritional ingredients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e., oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is regarded as the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils found so far.

The online “Summit for Democracy” held by Biden, the U.S. president, and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and private departments in 110 countries all over the whole world came to a close on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in the closing speech that the fire of freedom was burning in the heart of every one all over the whole world, which would never be extinguished by autocracy.
He also expressed that the second global “Summit for Democracy” was planned to be held in the next year.
Tang Feng, the representative and the minister without portfolio of the Government of Taiwan, and Luo Guancong, who was engaged in activities about democracy and human rights of Hong Kong and was exiling in Britain, made speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: “We know that we are facing with really tough works.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before, the world of democracy is everywhere just as what the summit indicates.
The low fire of freedom will never be extinguished by an autocratic regime, which is always burning in people all over the whole world. ”
Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were needed to guard democracy.
He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility of listening to our citizens, reinforcing the guard bar of democracy, promoting reforms, realizing transparent accountability governance, so as to resist to autocratic buffer and impact as well as those people who barely pursue for power in front of public benefits." ”
The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy” were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy.
That day was just the “International Human Rights Day”.
Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing with challenges globally, especially those caused by emerging digital technologies.
He said: “It’s the time to reiterate the common values and the viewpoints as well as the tenacity of democracy.
Deepened social dialogue is needed, to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls.
It is needed to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions. ”
Luo Guancong, who was engaged in activities about democracy and human rights of Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit with a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to give sustained attention to the human rights of Hong Kong and minorities in China such as Uyghur nationality and the Zang or Tibetan nationality.
He said: “For a very long term, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability.
This is the reason for cooperation between politicians and folk social leaders.
We have to ensure that the renaissance of democracy is our primary task with all our resources. ”
Luo Guancong appealed to unity of the free world to fight against the threats of the Communist Party of China.
He said: “Some of you may be afraid of annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, and some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our value system on democracy.
And these are reasons for our failure.
These are also reasons for us to make changes. ”
When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Tang Feng, minister without portfolio of Taiwan Executive Council, issued Country Declaration with a video, to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared the way to fight against COVID-19 pandemic with transparent information and mutual trust construction.
He said: “Before the democracy of Taiwan is in the ascendant, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic period, authoritarian governments all over the world infringed human rights in a rational way in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic conditions in no need of lockdown, and we can defeat false information in no need of removing from the shelf. ”
On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy”, Treasury Department of United States announced to implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries that were identified as involving in human rights such as China and Korea; at the same time, and to implement investment restriction on a company of China which was identified as infringing human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.
I have taken photos and submitted them to you.
I know that.
But I don’t know why the restaurant delayed the delivery time repeatedly.
I ordered #NUMBER# at first.
Anyway, I won’t place the order.
I don’t want to eat.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn’t you tell me earlier if you couldn’t deliver it?
I’ve waited so long.
No, I didn’t receive the call.
Please ask him to deliver it to my company again.
I don’t want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
I’ve waited for one and a half hours for my foods.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered.
I want to cancel my order.
Why can’t I cancel it?
Hi, the Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce delivered by the restaurant is raw and inedible.
I want to try tennis, and don’t know if you can insist on it, so I want to make practice with a cheap one.
In fact, price is often in direct proportion to friendliness; if you cannot distinguish, expensive ones are friendlier than cheap ones; in fact, the “beginner-level rackets” are industrial refuses.
They usually have low strength, leading to large vibrations when tennis balls hit on them; it is even difficult for masters to control it.
The logic and subtext for the existence is: tennis is really difficult, you will not be skilled in it, and you will not buy expensive ones, and you will give it up after playing to times; these ones are cheap, and you will not love them dearly.
When you can distinguish good ones from poor ones, you get progress; you will but expensive ones again, and I can sell two times of tennis rackets by earning two times of money.
I suggest you to buy a relatively better tennis racket of second hand with similar price, such as price or Dunlop; the two brands are not famous, with fair price, and you can spend 500 yuan or 600 yuan to buy a new one, or 200 yuan for a second-hand one, and you can enjoy the quality of a one-thousand tennis racket.
It’s friendly to beginners; however, it has little value after the beginner stage; however, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed repeatedly.
Could you help follow up on it?
Delayed.
Thank you.
That is to say, I’ve had the credit?
Do I need to place the order again, now? I don’t need to do anything about the previous order, right?
Hi, I ordered the food from this restaurant, but lots of my ordered foods are missing, and the Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce is raw and inedible.
#PRS_ORG# required me to pick it up by myself with no reason, and please cancel it.
I placed a delivery order, and I know nothing about self pick-up.

The picture was discussed heatedly after it was spread in the Internet.
According to some people in the Internet, this behavior is “begging behavior grabbing attention”, but some others show sympathy to her.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Games of the Tokyo Olympic, of course.
Do you think only Olympic players can win a prize?
An article named Look! Project Managers Can Go for the Olympic Champion was really popular some time ago; project managers can take the lead in many projects: moving bricks, business trip and staying up are ordinary things for project managers, not to mention fire-fighting, holding the bag and apologizing.
An article seemingly playful tells the bitterness of project managers, telling the ability not equal to his ambition to the current project management work.
People who work on project management select to get themselves from difficulties in work by selecting some actions.
According to increasingly grown number of application for PMP (international certified qualification for project management professionals), more and more project management personnel improve their project management ability through learning.
According to Development Report of Project Management of 20 Years in China (1999-2019), up until September, 2019, the accumulated PMP® registration number of the whole country is nearly 600 thousand person-times, and about 420 thousand of them passed the PMP® authentication, and the number of certificate holders is 300 thousand, standing for 31.2% of the total amount of PMP® certificate holders all over the whole world.
The number of PMP certificate holders during the latest 10 years has been increasingly grown year after year, indicating that more and more project managers have realized that it is not sufficient to work according to “past experience”; the working environment changing quickly makes us realize that it is necessary for us to explore the road by standing on the shoulders of giants of science.
However, does PMP can make us do well in project management works?
According to many beginners of project management, the learning of the PMP/IPMP related courses can help them systematically master knowledge points such as ten fields and five process groups; however, they are confused when they are facing with real project management works.
Many project managers often reflect the following problems: improper project management identification, depending on too much about personal experience or project management theories, knowing nothing about practice; lack of systematic project management process system, which cannot be implemented during work, failure in accurate estimation on projects, poor control sensitivity, repeated delay of projects; undefined labor division, knowing nothing about coping with the “old stick” in teams, unsmooth communication among different departments, difficulty in promoting projects......

The red packets for special offer when spending enough of various types and the attractive live-streaming sales make consumers gain benefits; on the one hand, this spending spree makes people feel increasingly strong spending power of citizens; on the other hand, people have to cool down to consider the influences of the consumerism on social and modern mainstream consumer groups.
Before the “Double Twelve”, Home Credit N.V. (hereinafter referred to as “Home Credit”) advocated to rational consumption, to remind vast users, especially young users, to establish favorable consumption awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Survey Analysis Report about Financial Quality of Consumers published by People’s Bank of China in this, the financial quality index of national consumers is 66.81, increased by 2.04 when compared with that of 2019.
Generally speaking, our citizens have favorable performance on financial consumption; however, there are big differences on various aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and further improvement in basic financial knowledge shall be conducted.
Senior citizens and young people have relatively low financial quality level, and they are still the key objects by financial education; according to the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson and the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People of 2019 – 2020 issued by CTV Finance, the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has been an important approach for consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation; although the young generation shows relatively rational consumption trend, which is different from the label of “excessive squander”, some young people indeed involve in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, or even increasingly grown social problems; financial enterprises shall take social responsibilities and guide in a positive way.
As a consumer finance institution with the certificate, Home Credit has always been engaged in constructing happy life for citizens with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish correct consumption view and responding to the call of the supervision units, to improve the rational consumption consciousness of consumers, especially young groups, with actual behaviors.
In the past several years, Home Credit has always conducted comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities aiming at young groups including university students; in addition, it has guided the consumption demands of young groups rationally and unconsciously by means such as innovative practice competitions together with top universities in the country, so as to help them establish rational consumption concept and rationally plan for consumption demands, so as to accumulate their life fortunes.
Before the arriving of the “Double Twelve”, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish rational consumption consciousness and correct concept of money, and resist against blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the wrong region of borrowing, to avoid influences of personal credit investigation and economic life in the future.
Plan ahead is very important for consumption, to achieve acting according to capability and making payment as schedule.
In overdue conditions, related behavior will be recorded in personal credit report, which may lead to adverse influences on economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is needed to select regular institutions and channels, and check if related institutions have the qualification for operation.
In the future, Home Credit will still provide consumers with diversified services meeting their demands with mature and reliable consumption finance systems and increasingly upgraded financial products, so as to improve their financial knowledge level and help them establish rational idea about consumption and suitable loans, to work as a trusted consumption finance partner for consumers.

Vietnamese People’s Daily – Gulf Cooperation Council coped with common challenges.
The places where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince, stayed included Oman, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis caused by embargo implemented by Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances to Qatar in the middle of the year 2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implement comprehensive embargo; they blamed Qatar on supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions led to serious influences on internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, resulting in negative influences on economy of countries in related regions.
The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, 2021, and various gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the boundary with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt took the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The divergence of the Arab countries in the gulf was resolved, to recover the relations with Qatar, for the purpose of unity for benefits of various countries and regional stabilization, so as to cope with common challenges.
During the period that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land route channel between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
A channel of 725km connecting between the two countries will provide convenience for travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD to Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation of 30 billion USD.
The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries coincided with the negotiation on an Iran nuclear deal named as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and major countries all over the whole world, an agreement that was regarded as cannot solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran by Arab countries in the gulf.
All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term "competitor" and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as the "threat" to regional security.
According to various gulf countries, it is defective to not solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not restrain the activity of Iran in this region with certain actions.
As the nuclear negotiation between various major countries and Iran cannot meet the demand of various gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
The objective was to restrain the upgrading od the tense situations in this region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held soon will be the first summit for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar.
This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that make contributions to recovering the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges, to make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.
I placed the order at 7 o’clock, but it has not been delivered now, at 9:30, and you shall refund and cancel the order.
Okay.
It is known as the supercar of the largest exhaust noise in the new mountainous area!
This model of car we introduce now is the dream of many men!
This model of car we introduce now is the dream of many men!
With the high price of nearly 2 million Malaysian ringgit and yearly road tax of more than ten thousand Malaysian ringgit, it is a car of four-wheel drive; why is it called as LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast can it run?
Well, of course, I do not know it; according to related data, it takes only 2.9s for the acceleration from 0 to 100km/h; when my myvi is just accelerated to 30km/h, it is accelerated to 100km/h, hum.
The low car body, the arrogant scissor door, the huge air inlets distributed surrounding the car body and the 6.5 v12 engine which can be unobstructed under the glass perfectly explain the style of Lamborghini.
I don’t need to tell so much about the car model, and you can Google it by yourself; I’ve collected some explanations that may not be acquired from Google!
It attracts too much attention, which will make the car owner uneasy! (In fact, it’s cool)
The car owner just needs to pay 1 yuan for gasoline for each 1km (the car owner doesn’t car it at all).
The car owner needs to practice the gesture to get on and get off, or it will be a little awkward (because the car owner may not get out of the cab and will be blocked half).
There is too much noise in the engine, and the car owner may get deaf after getting off. (But it’s also cool).
Ordinary parking spot will be very narrow for the car due to the very large size, and it may be damaged when the door of the car parking next to it!
The car owner may be lonely, because there is no competitor on the road (it’s my idea, unrelated to the car owner, ha-ha)
Don’t misunderstand me, and the supercar in the video is not on sale, sorry!
Please contact us if you want to shoot a video for your car!
If you want to know more information about cars, please check it in The Car Guide / People’s Auto.
It involves in a car accident of ten million yuan!
It is believed that all car fans know Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercar all over the whole world, and Porsche 911 is a million yuan level supercar!
A few days ago, an accident destroyed the million yuan sports car 911 and the ten million yuan supercar Chiron within a few of minutes!
According to the results, the high price is reasonable!
Achieve the same frequency and resonance between university spirit and time spirit - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of theories on school management and value pursuit formed by a university after long-term accumulation during development, which is the spirit of a university.
The university spirit is critical to the development of politics, economics, culture, science and technology and society or even progress of a nation in all ages.
Colleges and universities have undertaken unique mission different from other social organizations since the establishment of the first university of the modern significance; for universities and colleges in our country, they emerged during the time of stress of our country, with the spirit deeply influenced by traditional culture and time changes; the value idea of “benefitting the mankind and assisting in nation governance” and the patriotism of “developing the country through education” was advocated.
At present, with increasingly prominent trend of information and internationality in higher education, there are increasingly fierce education competition, science and technology competition and talent competition all over the whole world; as the important “supply end”, the structural reform of higher education is facing with unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially, the proposal of the General Scheme for Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Subjects shows the confidence and determination of our country in developing to a giant of higher education from a big country of higher education, which proposes higher and newer requirements on development of universities.
How to rank among the best in the world with a short time, to construct global top universities and global top subjects in the condition of some differences, to realize “corner overtaking”?
In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the late-mover advantage: realizing significant improvement on academic level and school operation quality by introducing overseas excellent academic talents and learning advanced experience from global top universities; the second one is the cultural advantage: inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and developing excellent traditional culture, to unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is the system advantage: give play to the superiority of the system in the socialist country, strengthening objective driving, collecting consensus and resultant force, optimizing resource configuration, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to catch up with and surpass the world advanced standard.
It shall be realized that in order to construct global top universities, universities shall manifest individualities and characteristics at the same time of bringing superiority into full play.
The school operation characteristics shall reflect the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective location, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
With respect to Zhejiang University, features on three aspects are emphasized in school operation: the first one is to highlight the features of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training: constructing integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, to form the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of crossed subjects: promoting optimized adjustment of subject system, building the environment of the crossed-subject system, and actively training the crossed emerging subjects and the landmark crossed achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: developing deep international exchange and cooperation and accelerating forming the industry-university-research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
During this process, the most important thing is insisting on the university spirit, to achieve the same frequency and resonance between university spirit and time spirit.
As for Zhejiang University, the school motto of “truth and innovation”, the common value system of “diligence, morality, discrimination and honesty” as well as “inclusiveness, reality, morality, practice and country governance” constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is the school operation direction and the important guarantee for cultural accumulation and mental strength, with abundant connotation and profound significance.
In which, “inclusiveness” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mind of “inviting all talents”, expressed as adopting the good idea of school operation and talent training in world famous schools; “reality and morality” lays emphasis on the spirit of pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall pay attention to morality at the same time of pursuing for truth; “practice” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, expressed as reform, development and innovation; “country governance” lays emphasis on the spirit of love the country and contribution, saying that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
The series of spiritual idea and value pursuit is the spirit of Zhejiang University with the history of 120 years.
“Clever people can hear speechless voices and wisdom people can see invisible things”.
It is necessary for universities and colleges in China to further master the time direction and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, to accelerate to become world top universities.
At the same time, stick to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, time spirit and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and common ideal of human.

When NFT is emerging rapidly, there is a new concept in the encrypt community.
In 2021, a block chain game named Axie Infinity gave rise to great influences in the Southeast Asia region; some residents who lost work opportunity due to the epidemic started acquiring stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet raising game based on the block chain, which integrates multiple playing methods including NFT; as the NFT project with the highest trading volume, it has achieved the trading volume of 3 billion USD.
According to TokenTerminal data, the daily income of Axie Infinity can exceed 8.2 million USD, almost equal to Honor of Kings.

The popularity of Axie Infinity delivers a new “palytoearn” mode to more people; with the help of block chains and smart contracts, players are not single players; in addition to acquiring joys and economic benefits, they can participate in game ecology governance.
The subjectivity is not endowed by the game producer, but ensured by the block chain technology.
I’ve read a news about share price, and my largest feeling is that in order to choose the track, i.e., the selection of the investment target industry, firstly, enterprises have to select the industry with large growth space, with the market scale of at least 100 billion yuan; secondly, enterprises shall select the industry with favorable future growth property, and take the industry with the best state in the next 3 - 5 years; finally, enterprises shall select industry supported by policies.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, and the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness and the roughness refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer up for correct tracks!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the strategic layout of 2022.
The tactics is to “do the things right”.
The strategy is to “do the right thing”.
The strategy is utilized to find the direction, and the tactics is utilized to implement it; there is the space of strategic thinking on most tactical thinking.
For example, based on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think if we shall keep deepening in the current field or expand to horizontal fields (strategic thinking); for example, based on how to improve the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think how can we improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); based on how to improve activity participation (tactical thinking), we shall consider how to set correct activity KPI, to achieve correct activity target, such as improving objective customer participation, activating high-value silent customers and accurately attracting new customers; based on how to improve DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider if the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian communities in the U.S. complained about recruitment discrimination by 3 Ivy League universities such as Yale University - Xinhuanet
Message from Washington of the Xinhua News Agency on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the U.S. submitted a complaint to Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the U.S. on May 23, to protest the discrimination on Asian students during recruitment by 3 Ivy League universities, i.e., Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
Asian Education Alliance, the leader of the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day.
According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants in accordance with the admission qualification of American famous universities has been doubled and redoubled; however, in the 3 American famous universities, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.
According to lots of research results, these universities “has discriminated Asian applying students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration” recruitment process.
As introduction by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in the 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups compared with the number of applicants.
The data from Department of Education of the U.S. also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate in Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have implemented quota of races to Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told the journalist of the Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the U.S. could made investigation after they submitted the complaint, and could adopt measures to prevent these universities to continue discriminating Asian students in recruitment after determining the facts.
They also wished that the complained universities could pay attention to this issue and changed the recruitment policy for Asian students.
The 3 complained universities have had no reply till now.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu understood a plant in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a property agency, and Mr. Lu decided to purchase the plant after looking at it for many times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a relative of the owner of the plant about the details of purchase, and made the payment of 200 thousand yuan through bank transfer on the same day as the deposit.
Lin signed the name on the Receipt of the Deposit of Plant Purchase as the receiver, and it noted, “If the buyer does not want to purchase the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the buyer in double, and both parties agreed to sign the Sales Contract of the Plant within 1 week. ”
However, both failed to reach agreement on main contract clauses such as plant ranges and mode of payment, and both parties did not sign on the sales contract.
Considering that both parties did not reach agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200 thousand yuan to Mr. Lu several days later.
Considering that both parties did not reach agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200 thousand yuan to Mr. Lu several days later.
For this reason, Mr. Lu initiated legal proceedings to Yuyao People’s Court.
After hearing, the court decided that both parties did not sign on the official contract, and it should be reasonably presumed as failure in negotiation; for this reason, the case was not applicable to fine of deposit, and the defendant should not undertake the responsibility for breach of contract of repaying the deposit in double.
The plaintiff appealed after receiving the first instance judgment.
The court of second instance has upheld the original judgment recently.
[Reminding by lawyers] The obligation of necessary prudence shall be fulfilled during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer shall fulfill the obligation of necessary prudence; for example, verifying the information of the owner of the house, verifying if the house is occupied by others; in addition, the specific time and location for delivery shall be noted clearly in the contract, to avoid dispute arising from contract performance between both parties.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the end of the “Democratic Summit” on Friday, The Foreign Ministry spokesman of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11) to express that the “Leaders’ Summit on Democracy” held by the U.S. actually “makes democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy with the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation, to change domestic contrasts”.
According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has imposed its own political systems and value systems on others, to carry out democratic transformation, and has sanctioned others in a unilateral way, and has instigated Color Revolution, leading to disastrous consequences.
Democracy has been the weapons of mass destruction of the U.S. in intervening other countries.
The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.
The meeting of 2 days was held in a way of video, and leaders of 111 countries all over the whole world were invited to attend the meeting, including the leader of Taiwan, China; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited.
China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There were questioned voice internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for some leaders invited to the summit who had the trend of autocracy, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and Biden government was doubted to have the real intention of the geopolitics but not democracy.
Scholz, the Chancellor of Germany who had just took the post, was also invited to the video democratic summit.
According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “The American democracy today greatly shows the morbidity, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital.
Biden, the U.S. President, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of Democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability governance, to fight against the power of autocracy and those people who barely intend to pursue for authority before public benefits. “
As he emphasized, democracy is not taken for granted, “we must keep update it in all generations, which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era. “
Biden also expressed that  with respect to global democracy and human rights, “democracy should be guarded by fighters when facing with continuous and worrying challenges”.
As committed by the U.S., there will be year-long actions after this democratic summit, including a proposal with the amount of 424.4 million USD, so as to reinforce global democracy and provide support for independent news media.
The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and opened commitments before the democratic summit held in the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
According to Biden, “all our countries shall implement our commitments and report the progress in the next year”.
Okay, I’m just afraid that he may deliver it to a wrong address.

The wetness of the soup rice was just right, with big quantity; tinfoil chicken wings, the specialty dish, was always excellent, and the soup of the day tasted good, and the cabbage mustard was well treated...
Good taste, warm services and delicious meat
Richang is an old restaurant, which used to be a internet-famous restaurant many years ago, a small building in Dongdan, with wood floor.
People have to wait very long at the gate to enjoy the soup rice, and the casseroles are cracking...

How to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky?
Different people have their own tastes; some people like collection and some like delicious foods, and some others like wine tasting; the Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is one of the most popular Scotch whiskey brands, which was awarded with the Golden Prize of International Wine Competition.
Each bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky has its unique taste, but people who don’t know how to taste waste its mellow taste.
Then how to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky?
The author will introduce for you.
The method to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is mixed with about 35 kinds of Scotch Whiskies, with rich fragrance and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with both sweetness and smoked smell in its rich fragrance.
It is mellow and fresh, with a slight taste of vanilla and strong smoked malt.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice, or can be mixed with your favorite drinks.
After Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky entered China, in order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, drinking Red Label whisky with bubble drinks such as Cola, Sprite or Sunkist has become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste but also bring joys in visual sense; the addition of drinks can dilute the taste of wine and change the flavor.
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granulated sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
Authentic Red Label whisky tastes a little sour and acrid, and the addition of sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon can bring fresh taste to the wine; of course, the sweet and sour degree can be adjusted as per personal taste.
The above three are the best method for drinking of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky, which can be taken as references; I wish that my introduction can provide you with some help.
Reflection on education: How can college examination make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places - Xinhuanet
Reflection on education: How can college examination make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places - Xinhuanet
Indeed, college examination has always been a “hot topic” for a very long time.
Students in campuses are from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels, as well as different learning conditions due to varied learning degree.
It is unavoidable that there are different feelings on the examination on groups with such diversified characteristics.
Of course, single question types, high repetitive rate and excessively simple questions will lead to another totally different feeling.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam with focused review before exam; if they have other methods, they may half the work with double results.
In this way, “study slackers” can pass exams or even with high scores although they do not study hard; however, “super scholars” have scores not obviously higher than “study slackers” although they attend each class and do well in assignments and notes.
In this way, the reflection of the problems in college exams by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University is reasonable; it is believed such status does not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this point, the 3 students who wrote the letter shall be praised.
In fact, all people who have been to colleges know that there are frequent phenomena of focused review, “extracting” exam questions from teachers, knowing the scope of the questions and acquiring the “key coaching” before exam; even more, there are phenomena of bringing notes to exam rooms or begging teachers to give high marks after exams.
According to the author, as a tool for teaching quality evaluation, in order to measure if the college exam is qualified or not, it is on comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the scientific questions on this basis.
Specialties are divided in details after entering into the undergraduate college stage, and many specialized courses are taught based on basic knowledge.
Without a doubt, the comprehensive mastering of the basic knowledge points of a specialty is the content to be inspected by college exams.
However, the knowledge of the undergraduate courses is basically basic specialty theory and basic commonsense, with not much space for changes from the point of view of knowledge points, which is basically fixed.
Just as what teachers said, “the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still key point at present. ”
However, no change in knowledge points does not represent for single exam question types and repetition of questions.
In many universities, there is the group of questions for exams, and senior teachers of related specialties arrange the papers, and the paper inspection work is participated by all the teachers of related subjects; in this way, it solves the problem of repetitive questions to certain extent.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficult degree according to general learning conditions of students, analyze learning degree of students, to lay emphasis on both basic knowledge inspection and ability inspection; at the same time, it is necessary to conduct creative design on question types.
College exam is the wand of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exam will give rise to influences on effect of college education for a long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter from the students, and has deployed the scheme for rectification in the whole university.
Various teaching units are required to organize teachers to develop discussion and self-inspection on class ending exam, and formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, and strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and audit, and detail grade evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive check on various teaching links.
It is a inevitable topic for college exam to solve problems such as single question types and repetitive questions from the perspective of mechanism; it is necessary to release corresponding systems; in addition, teachers are required to master teaching conditions in a comprehensive way by mastering both the teaching contents and the learning conditions of students; it is necessary to connect between teaching and learning, to form benign interaction and make exam in accordance with practical conditions, so as to make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places.

The photographer was really humorous, so that we were always happy during the whole day.
We had saw some cases that many wedding photography stores tried their best to make customers keep as more photos as possible during choosing photos; however, the staffs there did not show any intention to make up add more photos except for the 24 ones in the package (I heard that many girls who shot wedding dress photos chose additional photos of more than 10 thousand yuan in addition to the package of more than 7 thousand yuan; I was astonished then, and afraid that I would choose too many).
The editing of the photos was finished today, and Lanlan sent the photos to me; I was not satisfied with two of them, and they edited them for me again immediately.
When comparing my wedding dress photos with those of my little sister, I was really satisfied with my photos, they were simple and fresh, with the style I like best.
I strongly recommend girls to shoot your wedding dress photos at Xuanhan Mrs. Gold!

Negative in 48h nucleic acid test and the setting of the “buffer zone”, the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a document to require to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities – Xinhuanet
Message from Beijing of the Xinhua News Agency on December 11 (journalists: Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng): The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council has printed and distributed the notice to require to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities, requiring that people who leave from land border port cities (those connected with ports of Hong Kong and Macau are not included) need to have the negative proof in 48h nucleic acid test, and people who go to land border port cities shall conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time horizon mentioned above is from the date that various provinces, regions and cities determine the range of the port cities and the announcement of the notice to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is also proposed in the notice that the port cities with certain conditions can also set the epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within the administrative region.
According to introduction from related responsible person of Bureau for Disease Control and Prevention of National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and citizens of both sides have frequent dealings.
The regional difference management policy and the change of one preventive line to two lines can make the strategic pass move forward and reduce the risk of epidemic overflow, so as to minimize social influences and reduce social cost while achieve the maximum effect in epidemic prevention and control.
Multiple local gathering epidemic conditions have occurred in our country recently, all of which were inputted from overseas epidemic conditions via port cities.
According to the notice mentioned above, some problems such as failure in timely monitoring and early warning of epidemic in some cities, failure in implementation of closed-loop management in high risk posts, failure in careful implementation of periodical nucleic acid tests, failure in careful disinfection in all links of cold-chain goods, lack of standardization of management to concentrated isolation fields and failure in scientific and accurate emergency disposal of epidemic conditions are exposed.
It is required in the notice to lay emphasis on 9 aspects including perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing the management and control measures of port cities, to correct and improve drawbacks in epidemic prevention and control in port cities and lay emphasis on prevention and control in a scientific and accurate way, to prevent epidemic inputting.
It is emphasized in the notice that various port cities shall study and deploy epidemic prevention and control work and livelihood guarantee work in a synchronous way, and shall publish and unblock the hotline for livelihood guarantee, check and eliminate hidden hazards in basic living material supply and price, and shall solve and reply to prominent problems reflected by the public.
According to the notice, related port cities include the counties (cities, districts and banners), cities (prefectures, states and alliances) and municipalities directly under the central government of opened land routes, water routes and aviation ports, with specific ranges determined and announced by various provinces (municipalities and municipalities directly under the central government) according to demands on epidemic prevention and control.

A video of YouTube revealed the truth of bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet
(Source of the video: YouTube)
On December 11, a mini-documentary named Killing Machine of YouTube attracted broad attention.
The documentary tells all kinds of antihuman crimes by the U.S., including waging war in Afghanistan with the name of “anti-terrorist”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, using all armed might to indulge in aggressive wars, being fond of killing and indiscriminating slaughter of countless innocent victims for 20 years.
The U.S. army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing group, distorting human natures.
The U.S. army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years.
In addition, the U.S. army established “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”.
Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from more Afghanistan civilians.
Just as what the video tells, the U.S. “anti-terrorist” war “is increasingly terroristic”.
Wars did not bring in peacefulness, democracy, prosperousness or wish; instead, they brought in a country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.
Let us click the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorist”, and reveal the false mask of American democracy!
I’ve read the following article by chance which discusses on why customers require logistics companies in the bonded area to provide canning services on the perspective of commerce and storage period, although canning is a kind of deep processing, not belonging to the operation scope of logistics companies; the article can explain why customers want them to do so.
I’ve contacted various production lines of milk powder in many manufacturers.
In fact, bagged milk powder and canned milk powder have the same raw materials, with totally no difference.
Then some people may ask: why the expiration date for bagged milk powder is one year, and that for canned milk powder is two years or even longer?
Or: what is the reason of such large difference in price between bagged milk powder and canned milk powder?
Many consumers or mothers of infants think there are differences in raw materials, and canned milk powder has much better quality.
In fact, the raw materials of the two types are totally the same; however, people think expensive products are better.
Because of this idea, some consumers even say that canned milk powder tastes better!
Then I’ll tell you the reason for the high price of canned milk powder.
What is the reason for such big difference in price since they have totally the same raw materials?
When pricing for products, most manufacturers consider that it is difficult for consumers to accept bagged products with high price, which means low profit or even no profit for manufacturers; then how do manufacturers to survive?
Therefore, they set a much higher price for canned products, so as to ensure their profit space.
For this reason, most manufacturers popularize canned products but not bagged ones.
In addition, the advertising expense for each year is generally dozens of million yuan or even hundreds of million yuan, then where do they get the money?
You can imagine.
With the development of the society, there are increasingly grown expenses in market promoting, such as the expenses for promoters in shopping malls, the expenses for display in shopping malls, the expenses for gifts of products and the expenses for advertisement.
Therefore, various manufacturers keep increasing new products, canned new products, with increasingly grown price; in fact, these are the new products released due to the increase in market expenses.
They are released to acquire higher profits; in fact, the increased cost in raw materials is no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
Some other brands play hard in order to promote their products by cooperating with doctors in hospitals, who will be provided with commission of 30 – 80 yuan for each can.
Such operating methods are absolutely forbidden by Chinese laws; in fact, this practice is entrapping consumers.
Consumers are suggested to pour bagged milk powder into cans, to save expense; in this way, it increases the storage and sealing property of milk powder, with no influence on children.
In addition, in fact, the expiration date of canned milk powder is the same as that of bagged milk powder after unpacking; however, it is difficult for bagged milk powder to be stored, which is easier to be affected with damp, leading to moisture deterioration.
The delivery was late, and the food changed dry and hard after it got cold, completely inedible.

Don’t intimidate people at the starting line – Xinhuanet
We can feel the popularity of books of success science when we go to bookstores.
Most of the books of success science today advocate “the best principle”; i.e., it is firstly assumed or implied that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what is” the thing you need to do.
As much as to say, the most important and the most fundamental link of “how to do it” is passed.
For this reason, these books have the same characteristic: either doing the best or doing nothing; either 100 or 0; either climbing on the Mount Tai or keeping standing still.
All people will regard the “best principle” “really correct”; however, 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that “you need to make the resolution to totally change yourself”, which is just the critical weakness of many people.
If you shout “you need to change” loudly to people who stick to conventions and refuse changes, it is deceiving yourself as well as others and casting pearls before swine.
Most people display their ignorance before the word “change”, and difficult to make the resolution; or they may make the resolution of “change” because of momentary impulse, and take the first step; however, good times don’t last long, and it is very difficult for them to insist on it.
From Tomorrow on, the cross talk of Mr. Ma Sanli, expresses the “common humanity” in the most vivid way.
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the very high starting difficulty, which exceeds the limit of ability of ordinary people, making most people “bemoaning inadequacy in the face of a great task”.
Maybe the “second best principle” is the way that makes more ordinary people step to success.
The core of the “second best principle” is on “lowering down the threshold”; it advocates to the theory of “accumulating small progresses to make large ones”; i.e., people who cannot achieve 100 can achieve at least 1, because 1 is always larger than 0; if people cannot climb on Mount Tai, they can also climb on the small sand dune around home, because it is better than marching on the spot.
In general, it’s better than doing nothing as long as you do something.
The possibility of insisting for ordinary people is greatly increased due to great drop in the starting difficulty, and the success possibility is increased as long as people can insist on it.
The journey to success by observing the “second best principle” is a little longer.
In general, although the “best principle” advocates to make all people success, it can encourage only a small part of people; however, the “second best principle” can encourage more people, to try to make more people gain benefit.
Do I need to re-place my order now?
The phone was not answered.

May I ask when will it be delivered to me?
How do I contact them, then?
Please cancel the order.
I can’t wait any longer, thanks.
He still has two orders to deliver, but one of them has been completed.
Please tell me how can I contact with the deliveryman?
The first deliveryman told me that another deliveryman would deliver it to me.
The naked carp resources in the Qinghai Lake have been increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
Message from Xining of the Xinhua News Agency on December 11 (journalists: Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the information from Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake of this year have been increased by 7.1 thousand tons when compared with that of the past year, achieving 108.5 million tons, which has accumulated to be increased by more than 40 times than the primary stage of protection in 2002.
The naked carp in Qinghai Lake is also known as the “Huang Fish”, a precious type of fish only living in Qinghai Lake, which plays decisive role in maintaining the safety of the“ water-fish-bird” ecological chain and the biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
During 1960s and 1970s, due to influences of factors such as battue and increasingly degraded environment in the water areas for naked carp, the number of the naked carp in the Qinghai Lake declined sharply; the reserves of the naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons in 2002.
The naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed into the endangered species in China Species Red List in 2004.
Qinghai Province has implemented closed lake for breeding fish since 2003, and any unit, group or individual is forbidden to fish in Qinghai Lake and main rivers and tributary of the lake region, and the sale or the naked carp or the products is also forbidden.
At the same time, the protection intensity has been increased by measures such as artificial proliferation and discharge, cleaning up the river ways of main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable “channels for fish”, leading to increase of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake by years.
According to introduction by Yang Lin, deputy director general of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, up to now, totally 180 million naked carp has been conducted with artificial proliferation and discharge in Qinghai Lake, with the rate of contribution to recovery of the naked carp resource in Qinghai Lake of more than 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan Region in Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area for our country or even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area which controls the extension of the west desert to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of Sanjiangyuan Region and the Qinghai Lake Basin, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biological diversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has published the announcement of no permission of fishing in key water areas such as the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake this year, to construct comprehensive fishing prohibition in “two-river and one-lake”.

I’ve just read a very long article about girls’ menstruation.
I’ll popularize it to men.
Most girls experience the first menstruation during 13 – 15 years old, and amenorrhea will come at about 50 years old.
Then the menstruation comes regularly once every month in condition of good health.
However, it is not very accurate, and there is a tolerance of about one week, in need of preparation in advance; it may come several days earlier if girls have bad luck.
Time duration, blood volume and dysmenorrhea degree vary with each individual; some girls need three days and some others need one week; some girls have small amount of blood volume and some others have extremely large amount; some girls have no reaction at all, but it is so painful for others that they are taken to the hospital by an ambulance; dysmenorrhea changes with time, and some girls suffer from dysmenorrhea suddenly although they did not suffer from it at all.
Girls’ menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds 24h a day within those days; all what girls can do is to prevent blood from bleeding to clothes or chairs with menstrual pads or tampons.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused because of the secretion of the prostaglandin; oral taking of ibuprofen before the menstruation can solve the dysmenorrhea of the current month; however, nothing will work after the start of the menstruation.
Girls may have loose bowels before the menstruation due to metryperemia and too much release of prostaglandin.
If girls have loose bowels around the period, menstruation will come within two days.
It is suggested to change the menstrual pad every two or three hours, or it may breed germs; the menstrual pad shall be changed for at least 6 times a day if sleeping time is excluded, 7 days a month, and 42 pieces of menstrual pads are needed for each period; there may be 50 pieces when taking the ones for preparation in advance.
(I’ll make a correction, and it is not necessary to change the tampons, about every five or six hours, eight hours at most).
Girls may be irritable during the period due to hormone, and they may have instable emotions due to changes in hormone; in a word, it just like body makes them feel awkward.
However, according to crime rate disclosed by official data, girls have very high ability in emotion control, and they don’t seek excuses for emotional problems.
The articles bleeding out include both blood and the endometrium falling off.
The endometrium after the menstruation every month is the thinnest, and then it gradually gets thicker; it can be understood like this: the uterus is a house, and the house is built every month (the endometrium gets thicker) to welcome the guest, but the guest does not come, and the house is taken down totally (the menstruation is discharged), and a new house will be built the next month; it goes round and round.
Menstruation leads to inconvenience to girls; girls bleed 24h a day for several days a month in continuous dozens of years; who want to suffer it?
However, only girls with period can give birth to a baby, and menstruation; menstruation is coming in order to prepare for the house babies will live when they come to the world; people shall be grateful to the regular menstruation of their mother.
Women were often suppressed in the past, and some things were described as dirty and ashamed; however, times have changed.
If somebody feels menstruation disgusting, which is the behavior of women in order to give birth to a baby, they should not say it publicly; girls shall not have such an idea, and men who do not understand it shall not be ungrateful; how can they face their mothers and have their own babies with this attitude?
Girls can have a try of tampons, and they are really good.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is really disappointing.
I have to place another order for the children.
Please make sure to check the quality of the products.
Is there leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the foot tub?
Appropriate foot tubs can provide good pedicure and healthcare effect, and today the author of Gome will answer questions about the topic to help people who concern about it.
Foot tubs are increasingly popular with raising of the awareness of healthcare, and various products of different levels show in the markets, with price from more than 1 hundred yuan to 1 thousand yuan for consumers to choose.
According to related data, when compared with traditional home appliances, healthcare appliances such as foot tubs are getting increasingly popular; however, there has been no specialized industry standard for foot tubs, with certain security hazards.
“It’s really dangerous when soaking feet in water with electricity!”
Mr. Li told the author that he bought a foot tub for his father as a birthday present recently, but his father felt numb when he soaking his feet in the foot tub.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot tub; however, his father still felt numb after turning off the vibration function.
Mr. Li checked with an electroprobe, and it lit; he was astonished that the water in the foot tub was charged.
Then he contacted the merchant, whose attitude was good; the foot tub was returned, but Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that there had been no definite and detailed industry regulation on setting of the maximum temperature, applicable groups and materials adopted to ensure harmless in the foot tub field which had been popular for long.
In general conditions, there was no problem of charged foot tub; however, a few products may not be strictly controlled before leaving factory.
For this reason, split type foot tub is a better choice.
There is no safety risk because of separated water and electricity.
In addition, you can check with an elecroprobe at any time.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo was opened - Headline of viewpoints - Journal of Hunan - Huasheng Online
Message from Daily of Hunan on December 10 (all-media journalists: Zhang Shangwu and Hu Panpan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) The 13th Hunan Tea Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Introduction and Marketing Event were held in Hunan International Expo Center in this morning, to exhibit tea industry, innovate tea science and technology, advocate tea culture and accelerate to realize the industry objective of 100 billion.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Head Office, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Provincial People’s Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: Xinhua is the source of Hunan Black Tea, and the emerging of the black tea injects new energy for “colorful Hunan tea”.
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, to promote construction of the Hunan tea industry of 100 billion and form the development pattern of “three-Hunan four-water and five-colorful tea”.
The tea industry of the province has promoted innovation, and main tea types such as green tea and black tea take turns to generate power, and tea-travel integration is promoted in main tea production areas, to drive income increase in tea farmers.
Every dog has its day, and black tea gets popular again.
According to opinion of experts in the tea industry in the province, tea farmers pick up black tea after green tea, and have income in all seasons, leading to directly rise in the production value of tea gardens.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plate to the fourth batch of enterprises using the trademark of “Hunan black tea”, and Xinhua was awarded with the title of “source of Hunan black tea”.
In the exhibition hall of Xinhua black tea, a tea merchant from Fujian took a fancy to a high mountain tea named “spring in ice”, and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of provincial tea association, said happily that factors such as epidemic lead to influences on the tea market to certain extent; however, based on the conditions at the tea expo, there are various bright spots.
Xinhua black tea is popular and attracts many consumers, and the Hunan tea industry is celebrating the new spring.
Can I cancel the order if the foods are not warm?
I don’t want it anymore, he could not deliver it to me because parking is not allowed here downstairs.
Metaphysics means studying with rational reasoning and logic, but not acquiring answers directly from perception.
Metaphysics is the basic principle for philosophy, which aims to explain the existence and the basic nature of the world.
The Chinese translated name of “metaphysics” was acquired from “metaphysics is known as idea, and physics is known as device” in the Book of Changes, Copulative, upper volume, which was translated from metaphysic by Tetsujiro Inoue, a Japanese man (the meji era).
Metaphysics includes some branches, i.e., the ontology, the natural theology and the extended issues.
The ontology is “to study which nouns represent for authentic entities and which nouns represent for only a concept”.
The metaphysical naturalism means denying the existence of God.
According to the theoretical basis, all the phenomena can be explained with the concept of natural reasons, proposed by scientists supporting science and the theory of evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method not to speak a single word about God.

I spent so much to order take-out just because I don’t want to go downstairs to buy foods.
Ding Zilin: to my friends.
I want to show my thanks to all the humanitarian aid provided by my friends within more than 30 years since our relatives died in the accident; especially, the aid has never been interrupted till now since I appealed to foreign friends in my name in 1994.
Parents of most victims have passed away, and their orphans have been grown up and have got married or got a job.
It was your magnanimous act that helped families like mine passed the toughest time.
At present, the coronavirus pandemic is spreading all over the whole world, and most donors will retire soon.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humanitarian donation to the mothers of the Tian An Men group, which should have been ended at an earlier time.
I will forever bear your love in mind, and will firmly believe that your magnanimous act will be remembered by the history.
I have to express my will due to some reasons, and please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Note from Tao Ye: Please allow me to introduce the history of the humanitarian act by IFCSS and MCDF for 32 years.
During the humanitarian act, IFCSS and MCDF are two parallel organizations, with intersection in executors of projects.
(Apple Daily Chart: the website of the mothers of the Tian An Men is managed by Tao Ye. ）pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Sometimes, the aid fund could not be delivered to the relatives of the victims of the June 4 event.
In 1994, as suggested by Teacher Ding, a special group was established, in charge of receiving and distribution of the humanitarian donation.
In 1998, Children’s Education Fund for Orphans of June 4 was established by MCDF; after implementation of 11 years, when all the orphans graduated from schools in 2009, MCDF established the Relief Fund for Helpless Elderly and Poor Households, which has been implemented until now.
The funds of the projects were mainly from campus and social donations, as well as the MCDF.
Laogai Research Foundation has provided support from 2018.
Up until the last year, 31 years later, the relatives of the victims received part of the fund donated from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights was implementing its humanitarian aid independently.
We understand that Teacher Ding appealed to stop the donation because of thinking for the donors; we are actually retired elderly, with not as abundant salary as we did not retire; we are really thankful to the letter of “To my friends”.
We will respect the decisions of the relatives of the victims and will stop the project within 2 years, and will recover it immediately if it is necessary to do so.
I also want to show my thanks to the friends who helped others generously with money with risks.

Reviews by members
[Effect] Photo effects: I chose two suits of clothes, which were generally good, but I prefer the set in the photo.
[Service] Service details: I didn’t feel good during makeup for I was pregnant, and the makeup artist and the other staffs were thoughtful and made me have a rest, and they gave me hot water repeatedly.
Set price: 1,000 yuan
Thanks to the comment by Rabbit; I refused the ancient style at first, but they were so beautiful when I saw the final photos.
Thanks to the confirmation by Dandan; your satisfaction gives us more energy to move forward, and we’ll keep up the good work in the future!
This photography studio is truly great, and I highly recommend it for everyone!
It was perfect in reception, makeup, clothing, lamplight, photography and post-editing.
The makeup artist was very thoughtful and designed makeup according to styles of customers, and used cosmetics of big brands.
Not to mention Photographer Tian Liang, who was really professional.
The whole studio was surrounded with artistic atmosphere, with two little cats for accompanying and playing.
We work in Beijing, where we must line up for half a year for good photographic studios; some colleagues of mine shot wedding dress photos in Beijing, and I felt just so so when I saw the final photos.
I specifically found this studio, a studio with different spirit and attitude.
Most of us could not do well in facial expression management, but Photographer Liang could record the natural and excellent moments with candid photography.
They really have an excellent team including the makeup artist, the photographer and the later design.
We and our friends and relatives were highly praised after we saw the final photos.
I have recommended my bosom friend to shoot wedding dress photos there, and she was also very satisfied with the photographic plates.
I wish that such excellent studio can become known, so that they shoot more distinguished photos.
We really appreciate the 5-star comments from Zhanying and Jinglung, for both of you are insightful and creative new customers for us;  as members of an creative studio, we will try our best to complete our tasks as long as customers like our works; thanks to meeting and acquaintance.
Everyone in the team were very nice, including the sweet and thoughtful assistant and the cheerful and lively photographer; it was really a wonderful and unforgettable experience and the final effect was much better than what I imagined; thank you very much for your work
Thanks to the comment from Xiaoyu, and it’s our pleasure to know you; from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust is as much as the long way of thousands of miles; I’m really happy to know you, and welcome to Qinhuangdao again.
How should I pay for it?
The de-delivered food has arrived.
No deliveryman accepted the task.
An employee of the restaurant is calling me.
A freshman in programming who would like to share personal experience
If you want to work in this industry, you can accept training in an institute; however, if you don’t intend to work on it, you’d better study independently; after all, you need to pay a lot of money for training; in addition, it spends you 6 months to do so.
However, if you intend to work on it, training is a really good choice, especially for those people with weak self-control ability.
People who have strong self-control ability can choose self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
Firstly, the most important thing is the teaching strength of the training institution; it’s meaningless for you to choose a training institution with weak teaching strength; of course, new training institutions usually do not have very strong teaching strength.
Secondly, you can ask something about the training institution before making selection; you’d better ask something from students of the training institution; after all, only students of the training institution can know it well and know the teaching quality.
Hello, in fact, I don’t know how to answer it, because you do not introduce your conditions; in addition, study is closely related to conditions of students.
For example, specialty, age, targeted language or even city are related to your study or your intended industry.
If you are a student in school or a graduate of computer major, and you have sufficient time, you can learn it by yourself, with favorable efficiency and the lowest cost; a lot of offline or online training institutions are good choices, but with high study cost and much time, and concentrated training of 3-6 months is required.
However, if you are of the condition that I mentioned before, self-study is the best choice; there are lots of free study resources in the Internet, or you can seek for training resources in b station; if you don’t know how to find the resources, you can contact me with the method in my introduction, to acquire free resources, or you can have detailed consultation to me.
In addition, some classical books can be utilized, in combination of videos.
If you are not a computer major and you can afford the training fee and the time cost, you can study in a training institution; in this way, you can study easily, for teachers there will give you detailed explanation and answer your questions; in addition, they can help a lot in study planning or supervision.
In addition, employment agreement will be signed by lots of training institutions, with internal recommendation quota, and you can be commended to work for a company; it helps really a lot in the interview of job search.
This is my opinions; I cannot have a detailed introduction because I don’t know a lot about your conditions; if you have any other question to ask, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I required my food to arrive before 1 o’clock, which I can see in the App.
What do you mean
I’ve not finished talking, what are you doing?
I undertake various services such as (installing, cleaning, repairing) of wall-mounted furnace water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, closestools, cooking ranges, kitchen ventilators, as well as installing lamps, cleaning windows, beautifying processing of gaps, and housekeeping services.
Thank you for all the people who give a like to me; I will try my best to for a better life although it is really tiring.
Life will never let down anyone who works hard; please follow me, and thank you for all the people who give a like to me.
This is the life; others pay attention to only results, but I have to experience the process; we have no other choice but continuing the life, and we’ll never retrace our steps......
Cleaning is a job and is a responsibility; life changes beautiful due to services, and services are splendid due to thoughtfulness.
Although we did a dirty job, we will clean every corner of the home of our customers with the most serious attitude; when seeing the satisfied smile and the thumb-up from our customers, we feel really relieved, and what goes around comes around!
My daily work
--
Provide services and do cleaning in a thoughtful and diligent way, to keep the good memories.
Fenggui Housekeeping pays attention to every detail you concern on: we will try our best to clean your home.
We will work hard to clean your home with thoughtful services, to establish our public praise.
It’s my daily work to do sanitation work indoors and outdoors.
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will change dark without light if they are not cleaned for a long time; the same is true for our life.
We beautify gaps diligently and carefully, to create delicate works.
Give me an opportunity, and I will make you satisfied. High quality is the standard of everything; we are worthy of being trusted due to our professionality, and your recognition is the best encouragement for me!
It is difficult to work on any industry now.
But I always believe that we will do better than others as long as we work hard seriously; it’s better than just sitting and complaining!
Morning is the most important moment of a day, and all the wonderful things start from morning; I wish that you can start a new day with happiness, luckiness, health and wishes, and keep good mood in the whole day; good morning!
When we are little children, happiness is a thing that makes us feel happy once we own it; after we grow up, happiness is an objective that makes we happy if we achieve it; when we change mature, happiness is a mentality that makes us happy if we can understand it.
Do the truest and the kind-hearted yourself, and do what you want to do, with no regret; one way of the life: walk your own way; two treasures of the life: good physical conditions and good mood; live to old happily!
We will encounter with different difficulties during each stage of our life.
Most often, what restrains you is not your ability but your encouragement to positively face with difficulties.
Just face with it calmly since you cannot avoid it.
If you are afraid of difficulties, you will be defeated by them; if you face difficulties, you will solve them.

The address is wrong.
Hello.
Can I cancel the order?
I will place the order again.
Has it been canceled yet?
2. Although the right wing achieved its ambition in the history, but it was not long; it was short because it was really arrogant.
To be realistic, the right wing played positive roles during the social progress process.
The positive roles played by the right wing should not be denied on aspects of defining the standard of truth after the Cultural Revolution, improving science and technology by developing economy and administrative systemation and guarantee of human rights.
3. As far as I’m concerned, although I disagree part of the sayings of Li Weidong, I lay emphasis on his sayings and respect him; because he is serious to China and the social problems in China.
However, I object to his anti-communist theory; I think the anti-communist theory will certainly lead to revolution, which will inevitably lead to social instability, resulting in damages to people and swooping by foreign countries.
4. Patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and for people are required to change or improve China; the people who intend to pull chestnut out of fire with political speculation attempt is not the right wing but the bastard.
Let’s talk about the left wing.
In fact, the left wing includes the abandoned persons of the era and the politics.
If it is said that the right wing plays positive roles to the society, and the Communist Party listens to the speech of the right wing and analyzes their thinking; therefore, the left wing is good for nothing, and what it wants is just those abandoned by the Communist Party!
5. Seeing that some people are blaming both mob rebels and the left wing, I don’t think it is necessary to do so.
Don’t try reasoning with traitors or the left wing, because there is no reason to talk with them.
Don’t try proving that we are correct, and don’t make the traitors or the left wing to admit it; we don’t need to do so.
I tell friends like this: When the traitors or the left wing blame us, it just proves that we choose the correct way!
Many people used to have ideals when they are young; however, they forget their ideal or pursue for ideal in a bigoted way after they grow old.
They go far from ideals; even more, and the people who fight against devil become the devil themselves.
The left wing and the right wing refer to restraint and freedom, and the inborn gene of the historic culture of China leads to a left trend.
The right wing in the country lays emphasis on freedom, efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision, fairness and safety.
The society wishes an environment of fairness; at the same time, the conflict between China and the U.S. determines a trend of the left wing; it is estimated to continue many years.
If you cannot understand it, just give a like.
Nothing more, and Huahua is so gallant.
In recent two years, the blocking and containing of the U.S. on Huawei chips not only making Huawei trapped into unprecedented difficulties but also making “American system” enterprises suffer from huge damages.
The U.S. applies suppression on the China chip industry, and requires their enterprises and related enterprises in its allies to block the chip industry in our country, leading to the direct consequence that the orders and benefits of all the suppliers of chip all over the whole world are influenced, resulting in reduction in research and development investment of chip manufacturers and in production capacity, which leads to shortage of the chip supply chain all over the whole world.
Today, “lack of chips” has been spread to all major industries all over the whole world; halt production of car enterprises and rise in price of mobile phones, almost all the industries in need of chips are greatly influenced.
In order to master the autonomous right in “chips”, scientific and technological giants from more and more countries have taken the path of “de-Americanized”.
In order to firmly control the control right of the semiconductor of the whole world and restrain the development of the semiconductor industry in China, the U.S. has taken lots of actions recently by hosting the “Summit for Chips”, inviting 64 giants to form the Global Semiconductor Alliance, and supporting American local scientific and technological giants by making investment; for example, in order to take back the dominant role in the chip field, Intel, an old brand of scientific and technological enterprise of the U.S., invested in 20 billion USD to construct 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, and provided the chip OEM service.
Most people consider that the action of Intel will lead to certain impact, and may grab the “job” of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
This is because that as an old brand of science and technology giant of the U.S., Intel has been engaged in the semiconductor field for dozens of years, with large amount of talent teams and technical reservations, and will inevitably rise within a short term, to defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, pays only beneath attention to the decision made by Intel.
Zhang Zhongmou spoke bluntly at the “2021Master Think Tank Forum” held in this April that: It is really ironical that Intel constructs an OEM factory of chips.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel to produce wafers is because that Zhang Zhongmou still takes the resentment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to Intel 30 years ago to heart.
During 1960s – 1970s, Intel was a pearl of the manufacturing industry of the U.S., ranking top all over the whole world, and was the powerful chief of the global semiconductor field.
Up until 1980s, the global high-end chips had been always mastered by a few of giants.
The IDM mode was the characteristics of the semiconductor industry at that time, and the production of chips including design, manufacturing and closed beta test were all completed by the same factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a mode made some small enterprises overwhelmed; many entrepreneurs of semiconductors had to flinch when facing with the huge expenses for construction of production lines.
The division of labor occurred from 1980s in the chip industry due to market demands; Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were some companies engaged in design of chips in 1984, and thought that he could establish a plant in producing of wafers.
Before long, Zhang Zhongmou realized his imagination, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was established.
By aiming at the single link of “processing of wafers”, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company did not design wafers but only provided OEM services of wafer manufacturing.
The newly established company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was only a small potato in front of Intel, the giant in the industry.
In order to acquire capital support, Zhang Zhongmou went to Intel to talk about matters related to investment; however, when hearing that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was engaged in the manufacturing link only, Intel looked down upon Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and refused to make investment in it.
Zhang Zhongmou firmly believed that Intel looked down upon the wafer manufacturing services.
However, the giant who looked down upon wafer manufacturing in those days decides to work on OEM of wafers today.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is really ironic for Intel to work on OEM of wafers.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has exceeded that of Intel.
Facing with the powerful attack from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel does not dare to stand still and refuse to make progress.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has developed to the 3nm chips; however, Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
It is really difficult to catch up and surpass.
I won’t wait any more.
It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 17:06😅
Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.
What are normal public opinions?
We choose three top search topics randomly: Dragon Heads-raising Day, rise in price of Orion and the event of LaLaMove; the public opinions spread and form a wave peak, and then [reduce exponentially] (with a smooth curve), and finally disappear; there will be a small hump in condition of secondary public opinions.
We choose three top search topics randomly: Dragon Heads-raising Day, rise in price of Orion and the event of LaLaMove; the public opinions spread and form a wave peak, and then [reduce exponentially] (with a smooth curve), and finally disappear; there will be a small hump in condition of secondary public opinions.
What are abnormal public opinions?
We choose six top search topics of the same event randomly, showing the [isolated peak shape], the [sawtooth shape] and the [bluff shape].
The [isolated peak shape] is generated due to artificial heating, to give rise to attention from the public; the [sawtooth shape] is periodical heating, to ensure the topic ranks on the top ones; the [bluff shape] means collectively evacuating; i.e., the top search has finished its “function”, and new tasks have been received.
In Figure 9, the wave peak of an event is just the wave bottom of another event, with exact time; undoubtedly, the same group of online water army receives a new task and starts working.
We can see the professionality of anti-public relation: dozens of top search topics are ranking in the list at the same time; some attract attention, some are in charge of science popularization, some are picking fights, some are changing attention of the public, some are giving rise to influences on cognition, some are misleading judgment of the public, some are stirring up emotions, some are coercing in making decisions; the anti-public relation accounts attack with batches and nodes by taking almost all the factors in spreading of public opinions.
Spreading is a science; anti-public relation cannot hide depending on only objective data by putting all subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions aside.
There must be traces after walking; let’s dig them out.

Countries such as Mauritius firstly found Omicron strain infection cases - Xinhuanet
Message from Beijing of the Xinhua News Agency on December 12, reported by foreign journalists of the Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi firstly have reported to find the infection cases of Omicron strains, the novel coronavirus mutation recently.
Mauritius reported two infection cases of Omicron strains on December 10 for the first time.
According to introduction from Kelesh Jagutpal, minister of Ministry of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected person was a tourist departing from South Africa and arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person was a local inhabitant of Mauritius, who was detected as positive in nucleic acid testing on November 30 after contacting a person returning from South Africa.
The nucleic acid testing results of the two infected persons changed to negative after isolation and treatment in the hospital, and they have returned to their residence.
It was announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that the country confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.
All of the 3 infected persons were students who came back from other countries for a travel at the beginning of this month; all of them were not hospitalized because they were mild cases.
In order to prevent the spreading of the Omicron strains, the government of Cyprus increasingly improved the prevention and control strength.
All the passengers above 12 years old who enter the country by plane shall accept nucleic acid testing at their own expenses in the airport from December 6 to the next January 10.
It was also announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that they started vaccinating the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children of 5 years old to 11 years old for the country.
Kunbizze Chiponda, minister of Ministry of Health of Malawi, said on December 9 that Malawi found 3 cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.
The department of health of Malawi developed genomic sequencing for 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the 3 cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: Floor 12, Happy Home, No. 156 of South Ring Road
I went there because of recommendation by one of my friends, and I planned to make a basic decoration with the budget of 70 thousand yuan.
I suffered a series of tricks as soon as I went there.
It was my first visit to the shop, and I just showed them my floor plan; unexpectedly, they gave me the offer of 70 thousand yuan for decoration of my house of 135m2 before they had field measurement; they showed me something about their materials of brands that I did not know.
Their second trick was to push you to pay the deposit as soon as you arrived at their shop (the money that they will never refund unless you have enough energy to argue with them).
When I was hesitated about the deposit, they invited their “manager” to tell me that I could be provided with considerable discounts as long as I paid the deposit on that day.
This was really a big trick, and I was cheated to pay the deposit of more than 10 thousand yuan on impulse.
However, there were many problems in their offer: the budget of 70 thousand yuan did not include water and electricity transformation, any door, cabinet or bathroom, which were actually the major part in basic decoration.
In addition, they charged service fee higher than other similar companies.
I don’t trust the company now, and they pushed me to sign the contract as soon as I arrived there before making anything clear.
When I returned there to ask them make refund, their specialized team argued with me in a very experienced way.
They blamed all responsibilities on customers.
They tried their best to shift the blame to other shoulders, with really many details which I don’t want to tell one by one; in a word, don’t choose them, and the home of one of my friends, a decoration work undertaken by them, too, had really poor decoration quality; in addition, they added various expenses during later stage.
Cheaters, their company is the Longtou Decoration originally, wahich was renamed as Damei later, and it seems that Damei has closed down and is renamed as another name.
So please don’t choose a cheating decoration company like this.
Please check decoration companies in Baidu when you want to choose one, because what we spend in decoration is a lot of money.
Please log in or register if you want to ask questions to merchants.
It is strictly prohibited to publish comments on merchants of various types, and please refer to statement on commercial tenants for details.
Kunming Decoration Design Channel of Dianping.com provides you with latest information of Damei 360 integrated home decoration such as address, telephone number and business hours; come to Dianping.com to find decoration companies.
It’s so horrible, and please cancel the order if I cannot receive it within 30 minutes!
Is there really no other way? For example, change an address?
Okay, then you don’t cancel the dialogue, and I will definitely follow it up if I am not refunded within 5 to 10 days.
Can I cancel the order if it is not delivered to me within 15 minutes?
The Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce should be cooked, but the dish that I received is raw and inedible.
Appointment with the starry sky丨The geminid meteor shower will be the maximum on December 14 - Xinhuanet
Message from Tianjin of the Xinhua News Agency on December 12 (journalist: Zhou Runjian): according to introduction from astronomical science experts, as the final large-scale meteor shower of this year, the geminid meteor shower as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will be the maximum on December 14, and people who like meteor shower can observe at the second half of the night on that day.
This is the geminid meteor shower shot by An Jiu, a lover of astronomy of Beijing, on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most of the female celestial bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the female celestial body of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 minor planet, which is an apollo type asteroid.
The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred” by comets so far.
According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science, just as a new year blockbuster, the geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “show time” during December 4 to December 17.
The geminid meteor shower is known for its large size and the stabilization, which is called together with the quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
The significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large amounts of fireballs; which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photographers.
This is the geminid meteor shower shot by Yang Jing, a lover of astronomy of Tianjin, on December 13, 2020 in Qinghai.
Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower of this year will be the maximum at about 15:00 on December 14; and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is above the head, the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150.
The recommended index chart of the geminid meteor shower.
“In the last year, people were impressed by the geminid meteor shower; however, the geminid meteor shower of this year will be influenced by the moon light, with the splendid degree slightly influenced.
December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the phase of the moon as the waxing gibbous, and bright moonlight will lead to interference to observation; fortunately, the moon will fail in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher.
People who like meteor showers can observe it in a few of hours after moon falling in the second half of the night, but please keep warm. ”
How to observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is suggested to observe meteor showers not in cities but a place of high altitude with wide view, small light pollution, facing to northeast, and then observe with eyes after the falling of the moon.
It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have large flow on each direction, and do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower.
People who like photography can select lens with wide angle and large aperture, with high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting, in order to take blockbusters of meteor showers.
By taking stability and sustainability into consideration, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are necessary. ”
Reminded by Xiu Lipeng.
Is there any difference between laser television and traditional TV?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic owner shall be the liquid crystal display TV, and the differences between laser TV and liquid crystal display TV are listed as follows:
Firstly, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market.
When compared with the totally spread market positioning of liquid crystal display TV, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market; or we can see laser TV is the product generated for large-size screen monitors.
At present, the size of mainstream liquid crystal display TV is between 55 – 65 inch, and that of laser TV is generally above 75 inch, or even more than 100 inch at most, fully meeting the demands of customers on large-size screen monitors.
In recent years, the global sales volume and the global sales proportion of laser TV have been increasingly grown, with the proportion of more than 60% in total sales of TV of or above 80 inch.
According to prediction by The Yee, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by 140% in 2020, continuing keeping a high speed increase.
The excellent performance in the large-size screen monitor market is mainly attributed to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the diffuse reflection image-forming principle of laser TV, the ray of light sent by laser light source does not directly shine into eyeballs; when compared with the ray of light of backlight of liquid crystal display TV, its image-forming process is close to that of articles in natural conditions, leading to smaller stimulation to eyes.
According to the strict comparative trial between watching laser TV and liquid crystal display TV by the same people groups in the same conditions conducted by Ceci Lab of China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, 144 groups of testing data have been acquired.
According to data: laser TV actually has strong eye protection property, which even plays improving role in specific aspects.
At present, vision health has been paid with more and more attention, laser TV has attracted more and more users due to the advantage in eye protection; in addition, it breaks through another field for the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TV lays more emphasis on high-end market.
Different from the increasingly lowered price of liquid crystal display TV, the price of most laser TVs is above 10 thousand yuan, which gradually increases with the upgrading of size and light source.
Why can laser TV be so expensive?
There must be some reasons.
With constant development of the light source and the technical level, laser TV has lots of advantages when compared with liquid crystal display TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, when compared with the traditional projection equipment, laser TV has shorter projection distance, which can realize the 100 inch large-size screen experience within a short distance, in need of small space; in addition, the host occupies only a small space.
In view of brightness, the laser TV of a big brand can achieve the lumen of more than 2000.
In addition, with lower heating amount and less damage to equipment, it achieves longer service life.
Besides, multiple leading technologies such as the true 4K ultra high definition, AI system and bionic screen are equipped for the laser TV, providing users with more shocking audio and video experience.
In fact, it is the product of demand division; in terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audio and video players; users can have a try about large-size screen and insufficient watching environment; however, the same knife cuts bread and fingers, and don’t trust all opinions of only one party.
Simply, in order to get closer to the curtain, the ultra-wide field short-focus projector – laser TV, has to use the ultra-wide field lens and the reflector with expensive price, which is not in accordance with the optimal design of optics.
In order to shield part of ambient light, the very expensive Fresnel curtain with microstructure is utilized, and the price of 80 inch is almost equal to a liquid crystal display TV of 65 inch.
In addition, I hate it very much when projection manufacturers take the diffuse reflection, which is propagated as being good for eyes, as the selling point; the ray of light on the curtain is the direct light for eyes, and the ray of light diffused to the ceiling cannot be seen by eyes; if you insist on it, liquid crystal display TV is also “diffuse reflection”, isn’t the ceiling lightened when you open the TV?
Besides, if the projection curtain is not diffuse reflection, no image can be formed.
The heat spot (facula) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored; if large amounts of ray of light on a certain angle are reflected to eyes, it is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store has no branch store yet
We added WeChat friends and make an appointment, and then the female staff sent me the time schedule for selection, who replied in time.
I went to the store to see the photography works before, and there were lots of beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos, involving in various photography styles.
I and the female staff exchanged our ideas briefly after I got there on that day, and the female staff assisted me in trying two sets of clothes with patience and I finally chose one before start of makeup; the photographer laid some props before photographing and guided for my actions, and pursued for perfection in various details.
However, we did not exchange specific ideas about photography, and the photos were not of my ideal ones; however, in fact, these photos were beautiful🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer assisted in selecting photos and exchanged ideas about post-editing styles in a thoughtful way.
It will take me about half a month to get the final photos, and I’m looking forward to them.
It was the second time for me to win a prize in the lottery of free photo album, and I can choose a set of clothes for most clothes in the studio.
Finally, I chose a black gauzy skirt, to experience a different style.
It took about 2 hours during the photographing period, including makeup and shooting; the photographer of the generation after 95s was young, who was expected to give more advices in action guidance in the future; he was conversational, and I was happy during the whole shooting period.
Reply from Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store
It is on the front page, and come and see Queenie~
After I arrived at the store, I firstly filled in the name and the mobile phone number, and then chose clothes or wedding dresses; I tried three or four sets of clothes, and the staffs were patient; after that, it took me a lot of time for makeup, with good service attitude; the staffs taught me how to make pose, but my face seemed big; I was told that it would take me half a month for fine editing of the photos; however, they sent me the photos in three or four days, and I didn’t feel too many differences with the original photos.
[Environment] It was not bad on the whole.
There were a lot of clothes to choose.
There were three seats for makeup, and there was a photostudio.
[Service] Very enthusiastic and thoughtful.
The stylist was patient.
The photographer taught me something about actions seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will actively propose to reshot.
[Experience] The style was a little exaggerated, and my double-fold eyelids were changed into triple-fold ones.
The tail of my eyebrow was also shaved, which was a little bit awkward to me who do not draw my eyebrows.
I got the photos in about ten days, but I was not satisfied with the editing effect, for the double-eyelid stickers were very obvious.
Since I was not clear about the style, I tried two sets, and finally chose the black dress, and the female staff told me that this set was of the Herben ancient style.
After choosing the clothes, the hairstylist and the dresser dressed me patiently, with very satisfying effect.
The photographer started working after dressing and makeup, who commanded me to make pose, making the whole course easy and harmonious.
After shooting, I selected four photos that I preferred for fine editing, and the staff told me that I would get the final photos within 15 days, and the final photos were really satisfying.
I’ve waited for 3 days, but no replay has been made; I cannot join in the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan because my credit card cannot be recognized by your system!
It’s really strange that I paid with the same credit card every time.
I have to pay for delivery fee every time now.
The monthly fee can be exempted before you complete the investigation, is that Okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance on the platform of Small Umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an online platform of insurance brokers.
In terms of the setting conditions: According to the prompt in Regulation on Insurance Brokerage Institutions (modified version in 2015), insurance brokerage companies shall meet three key words: shareholder, no major illegal record during the latest 3 years of the launcher, minimum amount of 50 million yuan, and approval by China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, the three stipulations are rigorous, which can be summarized as being powerful, being approved by national authorities of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (the authority in charge of supervising all domestic insurance companies and banks), and good style of work of shareholders; as an insurance brokerage company, Small Umbrella Insurance is a regular company; after all, not all the insurance companies can achieve the 3 requirements.
Therefore, it is trustful.
In terms of the insurance products: The Small Umbrella Insurance is a supermarket of insurance products, and star products of many companies, i.e., the critical illness insurance, are sold on this platform; by taking the HTLIC Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance as an example, the compensation party and the insurer are both HTLIC, and Small Umbrella is just a third party intermediary agent, with no need to question its validity.
In terms of payment mode: Because of no operating expenses of sales networks and salary for salesmen, internet products generally have high cost performance, flexible payment method including monthly payment, which reduces the payment pressure of policy holders; at the same time, it can lift the lever to the maximum extent.
This is good.
It can be taken into consideration.
In terms of professionality of salesmen: This is the most important point; insurance is a industry with very strict requirement on professionality; however, customers can insure by themselves for many Internet products, leading to many wrong regions; with respect to health notification and occupation, non-insurance personnel often add their subjective awareness, and feel that they are healthy or they are in accordance with related stipulations, leading to many hazards in compensation, with risks of rejection.
I used to work as a staff of insurance telemarketing for “Wesure” (a platform of internet insurance brokers, just like Small Umbrella), and I can tell you in a responsible way.
Internet insurance is true and valid; however, some people say it not reliable because there is no professional practitioner for Internet sales channels, leading to many sales misleading.
By taking some marketing strategies as examples, 1 yuan for insured amount of 6 million yuan, a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan, there is no mistake for such marketing strategies, but the provisions may avoid the important and dwell on the trivial and do not tell policy holders that 1 yuan is for the first month only, the normal expense will be charged from the second month, from dozens yuan to 200 yuan; a lot of customers don’t know it even after fee deduction of one or two years.
They are misled to think they can acquire the compensation of 6 million yuan by spending only 1 yuan (fruit reaped without hard work).
With respect to a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, it refers to only special guarantee slip number such as 6666 or 8888; in addition, there is no prompt about it after the message of winning is sent.
The free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan (another trap for policy holders) is a short-term activity; without other commercial insurance, 60 thousand can do nothing in front of critical illness, which solves no problem at all.
Our country is cracking down misleading in Internet insurance sales at present.
Therefore, generally speaking, there is no problem in platforms or products; but there are problems about the professionality and the professional integrity of salesmen.
The owner of the topic is suggested to consider in a comprehensive and deliberate way, and many offline insurance brokerage companies have more varieties of products for customers to choose; some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I’ve helped 59 Internet customers insure with offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan/year for every one of them in insurance premium.
You are welcome to communicate and exchange with me if you have any question.
I, an agent of Mingya Insurance Brokers, have provided services to nearly 1 thousand enterprise users with the experience of enterprise management training of 3 years, and have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I customize insurance products for customers according to their demands; when insuring, I make comparisons among different products, to strive for the best underwriting results for customers; after insuring, I arrange and entrust guarantee slips for customers so that they can buy insurance with no worries.
Grow up together with each customer.
I wish that my answer can help others.
According to definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business that a policy holder can complete all the insuring process by himself after clicking the link of insuring.
During this process, neither the policy holder nor the insurance consultant needs to sign his name, and all the procedures can be completed by the policy holder only.
Although there is no “sense of ceremony” in insuring for Internet insurance, or even there is no printed paper contract, it leads to no influence on validity and force of law of the e-version contract.
This mode is just assembly line work such as “telemarketing”; however, it may lead to a critical problem; i.e., there may be unfavorable follow-up services.
Insurance is generally a long-term contract as long as dozens of years, and we need to consider if the “intermediary agent” we choose can provide us with services many years later?
Then how can I contact with the food deliveryman?
It’s almost three o’clock.
Then will I get compensation?
I noted to knock before giving me the delivery.
But that deliveryman just left it out of the door and left.
And with a wrong address.
Your deliveryman took my take-out in #NUMBER#, but I am told that it is in waiting now.
The deliveryman picked up my take-out at 19:25, but he didn’t start the delivery.
I’ll go and buy it, and do you need any other take-out food?
What shall I do?
Where is your deliveryman?
Do I still need to wait?
I placed a takt-out order.
Okay, then I’ll call the police since you refuse to cancel it.
But there may be safety and sanitation problems in my foods.

Please reimburse the discount code.
No problem, but don’t arrange for a re-delivery, because I have placed another order and I don’t like wasting food.
Thank you for your help.
I always object to slander and abuse of any form, and I cannot accept any personal abuse.
This is an inclusive civilized society, and we need to eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
Regardless of political party and school, the first one to be rejected is the uncivilized style.
Firstly, you sent the friend request on the Facebook, and then you published topics of scoffing, and then you tried publishing my home address and the name of my father on the social media, and I always adopted the attitude of no response.
Later, you were further intensified to tag me with the frequency of at least six times a day; even more, you discussed some vague and humiliating speeches about me with your friends on Facebook, such as the appearance, the stature, being good at giving birth to and bringing up children, and some messages about molesting, I... I also let it pass.
However, later, many of my friends sent your photo and your speeches about molesting on your Facebook.
Sorry, as a girl, I could not still keep silent.
However, after knowing that I called the police, you did not restrain yourself at all; instead, you were even more arrogant.
I don’t care about your political background or your identity or status, gender respect is required in our society.
Yes, you can continue your teasing, vague, humiliating and abusing speeches, and you can still tell that you just care about me or notice me, and you can think it not harassing, or you can even still deny that it is not your picture or you can still make all aggressive comments.
Ok, I cannot and I have no ability to prevent you from doing so.
I did not know you, and don’t want to know you in the future, and don’t find fault with my appearance and figure.
I don’t think any girl is willing to ask others to humiliate herself to make her famous.
My friends asked me if I was ok.
They didn’t believe me although I told them that I was ok.
I don’t think any girl would say she is ok after being bullied.
No matter in work, society, political circles or commercial circles, only those people who have even no basic morality will hurt a girl in this way.

The picture shows the Yongshu Island of China in Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) It is claimed by united states navy in the statement that the visit of the Ohio Class nuclear submarine “USS Nevada” to Guam strengthens cooperation between the U.S. and the alliances within this area, and shows the potential, flexibility and combat readiness of the U.S., as well as the continuous commitment to safety and stability within the Indo-Pacific area.

When talking about the crash of Meta by 26% and the market value evaporation of 25.1 billion USD, Zuckerberg replied 「facing with unprecedented competition」, then what is the reason for it?
Meta (the original Facebook) is an advertising company in the essence, with main income from advertisement; the advertising company earning money today has its own flow source.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., any functional localization is the flow source of Meta.
More than that, Meta is the largest”advertising alliance”, and many Apps cooperate with Meta in advertising, and change it into money through the Meta advertising platform.
However, time changes.
Firstly, it is very difficult for Meta to acquire the data information due to the adjustment in the privacy policy of Apple, which gives rise to influences on efficiency of advertisement putting.
The present privacy policy is friendly to users, and obvious prompt is provided about if the user allows the App to acquire his information, and most people choose no, of course.
Next, if Google gives an attack, it will lead to greater influences on the income of Meta.
Secondly, the Chinese factor is weakened in the income growth of Meta (there is actually the factor, although the specific ratio cannot be determined).
As we all know, Meta has no business in China; but, we don’t understand it accurately.
At least 10% of the income of Meta is from China, mainly contributed by companies engaged in sea services.
The office of Meta in Hong Kong accommodates several hundreds of staffs, and it has several major agents in Chinese mainland.
In order to expand overseas markets, Meta is a necessary advertising channel for China, and most expenditure is contributed to Meta.
Interestingly, TT is one of the main competitors of Meta; however, Meta made a lot of money on TT several years ago.
Various agents in China are helping TT put advertisement to Meta, and Meta enjoys favorable performance in Greater China.
I’ve never researched on it lately, but I believe that it will never be better than before.
The stage that Chinese companies burned money in large scale overseas has been finished.
Thirdly, the progress in new flow channel expansion is not as good as expected.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms including TT are not mastered by Meta.
The biggest problem is not only drop in income but also lack of growth expectation.
The capital market settles on not only income but also future expectation.
Obviously, Meta does not have a favorable expectation.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells something about the “metaverse”.
Metaverse is actually one of the directions in the future; however, with a long realization period, this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta within the next two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years shall be a tough period for Meta.
Although Facebook is magnificent now, with yearly income of 100 billion to 200 billion USD, in fact, Facebook has very strong sense of crisis; it has no moat when compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies.
Although all its social contact software have relatively high daily activity and are mainstream ones, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.; however, when facing with quick development of tiktok, Facebook is not confident enough, and it is a blinking of eye for tiktok to defeat it.
The concept of metaverse has no hope of success within a short period; therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, and this is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and keeps finding a new track; however, I don’t think he has chosen a correct track, but a road of no return; this is my idea for reference.
