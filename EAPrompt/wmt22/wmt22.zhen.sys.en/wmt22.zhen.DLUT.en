Students singing leading roles at the Zhejiang University Academic Conference research achievements make people's brains open - Xinhua
Wash hands with air, judge diseases with tone, and search for the source of haze Precisely Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with wide-open brain holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won prizes at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
The team of Zhang Di Ming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the side of a smartphone, half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is breathe lightly. This set of instruments can initially detect your health from the gas composition you're exhaling."
Zhang Di Ming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect temperature, pulse and other physical parameters.
And this set of biosensors uses graphene as a new material. Its target is the chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart operating lights: a doctor's high-energy eye
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver prize at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing, a master's student in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, and the team of Shin Junfei opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented smart LED surgical shadowless lights.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed at the early stage. They are related to the lamps used in doctors' surgeries."
For example, during the early detection of cancer, if the doctor can't see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread afterwards, Shin said.
This smart surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the difference of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the light spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Shaoyifu Hospital, affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Children's Hospital, affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rub more soap, and squeeze more hand sanitizer, while students such as Li Qizhang invented a "hand wash device".
As long as we stand on the washing table of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet, and is combined with water.
That way, we can wash our hands! "
The color reactions and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top schools and won the only gold award.

A certificate that feels very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I feel important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize it: First-aid measures are actually emergency relief in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, it is actually a while before the ambulance comes after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is the time for first aid.
If I do have a heart attack, a brain haemorrhage, a respiratory arrest, the window of our lives is only four minutes, and gold four minutes!
So the people around them understand how important first aid is!
When someone around us collapses, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there stupidly motionless and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is terrifying.
"In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year. The most dangerous is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70% can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing. "
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, the breath is gone, the heartbeat is gone, and you have no role in pinching people.
It is necessary to do artificial respiration and chest compressions before it is possible to save a person.
I find that few of us nowadays will have this awareness to learn first aid, but it's too late when things happen, so we're still calling on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when faced with a sudden situation.
Maybe it can also save a person's life!
First-aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Center. I enrolled at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. Students still have special offers.
PS: The last picture is to record your goals before the age of 25. Adding your first aid card to your target list was also a matter of months ago, but it's really done!
Next, I'm going to test for other certificates that I want to test. I'm going to test a diving license. Before I saw that there was a diving first aid license in Xiaohongshu, this license seems to have to have a first aid license to go to the test, so in fact, the first aid license is still very useful!

First of all, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad film, in all senses.
But if you want to say that the film is not a bright spot, it's not at least a good soundtrack choice.
There are many kinds of bad movies. It's one that allows you to sleep soundly in the cinema, and it's one that allows you to feel righteous and indignant after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is really gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature from the novel, and it's indescribable. It's like a trench coat on Little Marco's body.
Even after watching it, you'll wonder if there's an implicit metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, you find that it's actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I'll simply talk about some episodes that I'm hard to understand.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother's fate.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and the plot arranged for a big man in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Older people watching snow from the south to the northeast in a van?
He and his dad are still very relieved about it.
Then the old man didn't follow.
How does the hostess brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's Flying Car Party jerk lightly close a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering rebar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't find it all around.
This prop sensation is too obvious.
Why would a small-mix fly-truck party with no credit and suspicion of illegality become a auxiliary police?
In the face of usury why don't you call the police, the police in the movie also asked whether it's difficult?
An adult understands the use of a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner, sitting outside the door of the room for a night's sleep?
This inexplicable plot is so outrageous that it pains me to recall it throughout the film.
Beyond the plot, what's worse is the film's thrust, or that the movie doesn't have a thrust at all, is an abominable-looking stitching weirdo.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through watching it, you thought that it might be a drama that wanted to embody the difficulties of survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you simply didn't know what you had actually watched. What followed was a deep suspicion of yourself. Why did you want to run to the cinema to admire the shit?
For most people, it's actually very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted rookie is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love movie, tell the truth about the feud between a young man in a small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and his waitress.
If you want to reflect the reality, at least your plot can't show up with something that's contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's character, whose new motorcycle just burned and then can sing, can't open some brain holes that Kennedy can't even watch.
As for the hostess who is clearly not mentally retarded to behave like a 5-year-old in some ways, I don't know whether that's the reason for the acting or the director's request.
I also can't quite understand why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crashes to his own movies.
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival stall to add a jam to the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou Jingbian brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, well wall module machinery professional manufacturers, from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through many years of practice and development, we now have excellent quality, and mainly produce hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated well inspection equipment and ancillary devices.
Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou Jingbian brick module equipment assembly site:
Check the characteristics and advantages of the well concrete module production and processing equipment of Zhengzhou Jingbian brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well blocking machine equipment is widely applied to the new masonry materials of coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures.
Such as: various inspection wells of drainage and water storage facilities, storm water ports, square trenches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the top and bottom left and right quadrangles of the modules are concave convex grooves, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of well wall is far superior to the masonry form of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combination of masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected, the transverse holes are coherent, and after the core of the holes is cast, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a secondary strengthening and waterproofing role.
The module has a slot for insertion, and the transverse and longitudinal insertion correspondingly increases the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built using the concrete inspection well module are not easy to collapse, sink, leak, and other phenomena. The mechanical properties of the well wall module are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming size is standard.
The intelligent control of the brick machine equipment of the concrete inspection well module is equipped with data input and output device one-click through the touch LCD display to monitor the whole process of the mechanical operation, and to achieve the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of bulk materials, density operation, safe logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic, conveying, and double-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of the machine's vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system's work.
Concrete inspection well module Brick machine equipment and cloth box moving mold box rising, storage box door closed, automatic conveying tray, all by the hydraulic system independently completed, so as to reduce the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical appliances, seal hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of the collateral protection equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical excitation platform of the well wall module adopts integral sheet steel, and there is no welding point for the surface line cutting and closing die, so that the filler box is free to swing and guide, and mechanical wear is fully reduced.
Make the mold load reduction, filler and two-in-one encrypted amplitude, adopt integrated, full synchronization, table vibration, mold vibration, to ensure that the vibration effect is achieved.
Well wall module Mechanical excitation machinery, computer automatic control amplitude adjusts the amplitude according to the cost of raw materials, no wear braking, thus extending the service life and reducing the cost.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Middle Vocational School is an enterprise's prospective employee when enrolling in a pilot modern apprenticeship system - Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle-career schools. Students who receive the pilot training also have apprenticeship status. After admissions, students will be prerecorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and admission procedures of middle-vocational schools and the enterprise employment procedures be standardized, and that the dual identity of the middle-vocational school students and the prospective employees of the enterprise be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way choice, the apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and not reached the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific positions, teaching contents, and protection of the rights and interests of the apprentices cultivated on the job.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out the pre-employment training and transfer training of enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
School enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the education system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the internship in the top post is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one teacher can bring 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that the students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, 60 municipal mid-career modern apprenticeship pilots were identified in three batches in our city, with each pilot number of around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting and implementing it first, and gradually implementing it from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education of school enterprises, so as to effectively improve the skills of students in posts, and improve the employment rate and employment quality of students.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe the illness caused by the new omicron variant of the coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the newly treated patients they are treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but no patients have yet to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said.
He said this includes older patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus infection.
By comparison, he said, in the last wave of the delta outbreak, the new patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. "
In the two weeks since the mutant omicron strain was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of new patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave. The average length of hospitalization has decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of recent new patients have died, while in South Africa's early outbreak, the proportion of deaths has reached 20%.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Institute, said, citing data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports.
He also said: "It's still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths happen later, and we're only two weeks into this wave. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalizations while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although delta remains the dominant new strain of coronavirus in the world, omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If the famous public service advertisement is analogized with "no sale, no killing", then, in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", the collective prevention and national anti-trafficking make the abduction and trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency publishing platform for missing children developed by the Counter-Kidnapping Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and timely retrieve abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I felt warm.
The new technological means not only have the name "literary and artistic" and are full of feelings, but also are properly applied, practical and effective in informatization.
The primary goal of combating abduction and law enforcement is to recover the abducted children, and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education, can enumerate a lot of "big words".
However, before the abduction case is resolved, priority should be given to the safety of the victim.
The matter is prioritized. Under the eager purpose of "rescue", such as "whether abduction and sale of children should be carried out with the death penalty" and other widely held and controversial topics can be put on hold and discussed carefully; however, the matter of rescuing abducted children should not be discussed.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the place of commission as soon as possible after they have been successful.
When the abduction operation is delayed by one minute, the child may be further away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "reunion" platform that directly help to solve the case and retrieve the child.
After all, "fighting abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the entire legal system.
The fight against crime and the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the rigorous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the care of "child care and support".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can also be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a railway station, and the parents slept, only to wake up and find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should be at least fairly protective.
Taking turns resting for both parents, or placing their children under safe protection, is the minimum means to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party buying the abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the legal penalty for the crime of abducting and selling children is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the property confiscated.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is high. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people's concepts in raising children are backward, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously.
In order to effectively control the crime of trafficking, the official law enforcement cannot be relied on alone.
If the "market" for abduction is widespread, the abductor is lucrative, constantly innovating the means of abduction, and forming a "fighting law" situation with the law enforcement, the fight against abduction will inevitably fall into the mire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the backward concept and popularizing common knowledge of the law will also help to eradicate the crime of abducting and selling and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into Virgin Olive Oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and Refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil and fat obtained by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other treatment directly from the fresh olive fruit.
According to the difference in acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest-grade, highest-quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and elegant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): Slightly acidic, but not more than 2%, with a pure, aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin: Flavor and flavor are fair, acidity is not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with acidity above 3.3%, or becoming a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is transparent and pale golden brown.
Refined Olive Impurities Oil or Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil is extracted from oil residue by dissolution and refined.
Having read the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olive fruit is just like the grapes that make wine. Olive fruit from different regions and different varieties of olive fruit will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best places to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation conditions for the growth of olives.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, sporadic cultivation can only take place in the habitat in other regions.
The main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and similar climates include Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
Months of picking olives:
Every year, from March to June, it's time for the oil olive tree to bloom and sit on the fruit. From July to October, the fruit starts to develop and mature. The fruit transitions from green to red, purple and finally black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, linoleic acid, and vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition found so far.
Democracy summit comes to an end, and Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by the governments of 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders, came to an end on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he planned to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwanese government and a government councillor, and Luo Guanzhong, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist currently living in exile in the UK, also spoke at the next day's summit.
Biden said: "We know how hard the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because I've said before that, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, and it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, more resilient to the power of authoritarian cushions and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight authoritarianism, and counteract digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
The day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech of the day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Law Guanghong, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of China's ethnic minorities in Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it to account.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use every [resource] we have to ensure that the rejuvenation of democracy is our number one priority. "
Luo also called for the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to upset General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [of the CCP] to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. '
Tang Feng, a political member of the Taiwan Executive Council, released the National Statement via video during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values", stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we can beat the false information without flying off the shelves. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Summit for Democracy" schedule, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions in accordance with the law on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China, North Korea and other countries, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't persevere, so I want to find a practicing hand at a similar price.
Not friendly. In fact, the price tends to be proportional to the degree of friendliness. If it can't be distinguished, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap beat. Such "starter shots" are actually industrial waste.
They are very low-intensity, the ball hits the top of the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't resist, and the master is very difficult to handle.
The logic and subtext of their existence is -- tennis is so difficult, knowing that you can't learn it, and knowing that you don't want to buy expensive goods, make a cheap fool of you, and you play twice, and you won't play again, so that the beat is cheap, and you won't be distressed.
When you can really tell the difference between the good and the bad, it shows that you have progressed, and come back to me in time to buy the expensive one. I earn twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Denglupu's. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't sell at the price. A new 500 or 600 is very good. The second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan of rackets, is it not pleasant to enjoy?
It's very friendly to the novice, but once the novice stage is over, it's too bad. But most people, especially the girls, can't get past the novice stage.

In fact, there's a lot of emphasis on dressing and matching for the fat girl.
A fat girl can't wear a skirt that's too short or too long, the length is almost at the knee, and it can cover the place where her thighs are fat.
Too short a skirt can reveal the fatness of the legs.
Too long can give a person the feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear three sections above and below, it appears that you are naturally taller. It is that the upper body, skirt and stockings use different colors, and it will appear to have a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are standard for micro-fat girls (which the author deeply understands). Dark colors are also a good way to mask your body fat. The noble and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice for micro-fat girls.
Dressing in dark colours, especially a short black skirt, can make you feel thinner.
If the calf is fat, don't wear socks and shoes too attention-grabbing.
The more popular the better, the color should not be too bright.
Lest people pay attention to your legs and feet, it makes people feel obese.
For the slightly fat girl must talk about the trick of dressing and matching.
Microfat girls should never wear a short skirt that is tight. In addition, the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt. It will make people look very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, you should wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind of fine plaid oh). Choose a soft print flared skirt with a swing collar, which can very well cover up the shortage of fat girls.
Of course, micro-fat girls are also attentive in wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts. They should choose a top that is consistent with the color of the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat body.
Short skirt with high heels, you can make your legs appear more slender, this is the most IN of the summer!
If you're a MM with a fat upper body but very thin legs, it's recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
Not only can you cover your belly, but you can also show your advantages.
A-word short skirts will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, and the upper should be chosen to be tight, forming layers will feel more thin.
Simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also be tried.
Microfat girls are also able to dress in a fashion sense.
As long as they can master the law of dressing and matching so fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After a change in dressing and matching, you should also exercise more in your life, and strive to get rid of the label of microfat girls one day earlier.

Girls are targeted as arrows to raise money for her sister: "It's OK to think of a flesh injury" - Xinhua
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "human meat target, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou Girl Gan Dang 'Arrow Target' to raise money for her sister" blasted the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than an individual. The wooden board has the words "human meat target, 10 yuan, one arrow" written on it, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda of the Xiaocheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an excessive move by soliciting money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being cautioned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls "street" arrow target "fundraising is admonished
In the online image, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with "human flesh target, 10 yuan, 1 arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it surfaced online.
Some netizens believed that the move was an "eyeball begging act", and many netizens sympathized with it.
"We found out about the situation when we patrolled to the side of the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were a lot of onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed up youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl who made the "human flesh target" has been crying, asking the passer-by to play this game; another girl helped shout at the side, saying that her friend's older sister has leukaemia, and now urgently needs the surgical fees. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of propaganda of the Xiaocheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 costs, for a moment, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money, then made this behavior.
He said that in the whole process, two girls were targeted and one was responsible for laying down hands, but did not participate in it. No archery was found in the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and sent them to the microblogging site.
After the police were identified by the security department, the bow and arrows used did not fall under the scope of control.
The person in charge said that "this kind of eyeball fundraising method is not advocated."
After being cautioned by the police station's police, she had left the station.

What's the hottest thing in 2021?
It's the Tokyo Olympics, no doubt.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was a "Quick Look! Olympic Projects in which Project Managers Can Impact Gold Medals" article that was very hot. It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can: lifting bricks, traveling for work, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers. Fighting fires, backing pots, and apologies are not the case.
An article that seems to joke and spoof, but also tells the daily poignancy of the project managers, behind which is not enough for the current project management.
And the personnel engaged in project management, also gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament in their work.
From the annual climb of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) enrollment, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP ® applicants in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP ® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid license holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
The number of PMP license holders has increased year by year in the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying the "old experience" of the past. The rapidly changing work environment lets us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth management of the project?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP / IPMP and other related courses, you can systematically grasp the ten major areas of project management and the five process groups and other relevant knowledge points, but when you truly carry out the project management work, you are still in a daze.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: Project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land at work, project estimation is not accurate, poor control sensitivity, project delays; unclear division of labor among members, "old oil bars" in the team do not know how to cope with cross-department assistance communication is not smooth, project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has focused on product innovation and R & D management for more than 10 years, has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R & D talents, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R & D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other online courses have come with the "R & D Project Manager Special Camp".
The online course "R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" is a way of online fragmented learning. It combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D-based enterprises to help you grasp the necessary knowledge and standard actions of the project manager and embark on the progressive path of your own project management.

Jixin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observatory - Professional Finance News
This year, the amount of online payment business transactions in the "Double 11" Carnival nationwide reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which hit a new high compared to previous years.
A variety of red envelopes have been reduced, and the eye-catching live broadcast with goods has once again allowed consumers to benefit. This consumption boom has, on the one hand, lamented the growing strength of national consumption, and, on the other hand, had to calmly consider the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Jixin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jixin") issued rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an improvement of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, China's residents perform well at the financial consumption level, but they exhibit significant differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and they need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of continued attention in financial education. The "Report on the Debt Situation of Chinese Young People" published by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" published by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of the young people are using credit products, and nearly half of the people are not accumulating debt. Although the younger generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive profligacy" label affixed by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption, and follow the trend of consumption. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risk have arisen, and
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jixin has been committed to helping the people build their happy lives with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating that consumers establish a good and correct consumption outlook, and responding positively to the call of regulation to enhance the rational consumption consciousness of consumers, especially the young.
In the past many years, Jixin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people by cooperating with top domestic institutions to launch innovation and practice contests and other forms, to help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan their consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
At the time of the twelfth twelfth, Jixin reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and the correct money outlook, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and circumvent consumption and loan misunderstandings, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is important to plan ahead and make repayments on time.
If the deadline is overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect future economic life such as buying a car, buying a house, etc.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it should also choose the formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Jixin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products to bring more relevant needs and diversified services to consumers, continue to help the masses improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a lifelong trusted consumer financial partner.

Vietnamese People's News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on them, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar stems from the requirement that they must unite in the interests of all countries and regional stability, and aims to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain of citizens of the two countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the companies of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with Iran's negotiations with the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that Gulf Arab states have condemned for not resolving the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran to meet the aspirations of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first for the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time to propose measures to enable its member States to fully cooperate in order to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is claimed that the exhaust sound of ultra-running in the new mountainous area is the largest!
This time our team brought this car to you, it is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship ultramarathon and Murcielago's replacement model - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly RM2 million. A year's road tax is RM10,000. Four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That counts Xiaobi also doesn't know. The data says that 0-100km / h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. It's probably that Xiaobi's myvi will get to 100km / h when it's 30km / h, well.
The low body, bustling scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and unobstructed 6.5 v12 engines under the glass perfectly exemplify the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car model, Google it yourself for a moment, and Xiaobi has sorted out some commentary that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too high-profile, everyone is watching everywhere they go, and it's very uncomfortable! (It's actually a bit refreshing)
1km oil money around RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
You should practice the posture of getting on and off the bus, or it will be a bit embarrassing (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you'll be deaf when you get off. (It's still very refreshing, though)
The body is too big, parking in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, I'm afraid to be knocked when the next car opens the door!
It's a bit lonely, because there's no opponent on the road (Xiaobi own said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video's ultra run is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!
More information about cars you don't know is available at The Car Guide / People's Auto Register
It's involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that the Chiron is one of the most expensive ultra runs in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is a million rating!
That day ago, foreign countries crashed out of millions of sports cars in just a few minutes 911 and 10 million ultra-run Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate together - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a university's long-term accumulation in the development process of a series of ideas and value pursuits, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit is essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has been shouldering a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our universities, emerging from the autumn of national distress, its spirit is deeply affected by the changes of traditional culture and times, and it advocates the value concept of "Ming and virtue, build peace" and the patriotic duty of "learning and power".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly apparent, and competition for education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying across the world. As an important "supply side", the enterprise of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for the Integrated Advancement of the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" demonstrates the confidence and determination of China to move from a major country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, and at the same time puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to become one of the world's first-class ranks in a relatively short time, accelerate the construction of several world's first-class universities and a batch of world's first-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "curve overtaking"?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, confident pathways and confident abilities, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: First, they should achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of running schools by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, and secondly, cultural advantages, inheriting the intellectual connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated in 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, in order to gather strength, shape brands and improve image; and thirdly, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional superiority of the socialist country, strengthen the goal-driven, pool consensus and synergy, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate to catch up with the advanced level of the world.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in thousands of schools. At the same time, each school must show its personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school-run traditions and resource endowments.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in the running of the school: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, building an integrated education environment that integrates science and education, and university enterprises, and forming a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating an institutional environment with cross-discipline disciplines, and actively cultivating cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting achievements; third, highlighting the characteristics of the running system and social services, carrying out deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of the Pan Zhejiang University industrial and academic research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and allow the university spirit to resonate with the zeitgeist.
For Zhejiang University, the "seek for innovation" school motto, the common values of "diligence, practicing morality, discerning, and honesty" and "Haina River, Enlightenment and Heavy Virtue, Open Objects and Former People, and Tree and Country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and manifests itself in the high-quality concept of drawing on the world's famous universities to run schools and educate people; the "Enlightenment of Truth" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking to good, referring to the university's pursuit of truth, and more importantly, to embrace the cultivation of virtue and the striving of personality; the "open-minded former people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, not only the pursuit of knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, but also the transformation and development of innovation; the "tree of our country" emphasizes the patriotic dedication, and
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University, which has been running schools for 120 years.
"The wise listen to the silent, the clear see the unseen".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall picture of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation and historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation excite each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus to realize the prosperity of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At a time when NFTs are on fire, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost jobs due to the pandemic have started to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-farming game with blockchain technology as the ground-breaking level. It brings together a variety of gameplay methods, including NFTs. It is currently the most traded NFT project, and has exceeded $3 billion as of now.
According to Token Terminal, Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million a day, pushing straight for "King's Glory."
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that it had more than 1 million daily users.
The fervor of "Axie Infinity" passes a new "paly toearn" mode to more people. Through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, the player is no longer a single character. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, he can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game's makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news report on the share price of a friend, my biggest impression is the choice of enterprises on the racetrack, which is to refer to the choice of the investment target industry. First, we must choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; Second, we must choose an industry with good growth in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth after the next 3-5 years; Finally, we must choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is referring to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustments to the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do it right", which is to do it right.
And the strategy is to do "other right thing", which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find a direction, and the tactic is to land. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to deepen continuously in the current field or extend it horizontally (strategic thinking); on top of improving the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of enhancing activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as enhancing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silencers, and accurately pulling new; on top of enhancing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has hit several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities Regulatory Commission approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, and the re-expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" that improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Fang Fang, with beautiful eyes and generous looks, is a good wife and mother at first sight, and will be diligent and thrifty.
The groom is earned, happy in life, and beautiful.
The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like the Internet said, the photos I took with my loved one were very handsome and beautiful, and we were very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude is also very warm.
This tour took not only the beautiful scenery, but also the beautiful wedding photos, and also met the photographer's good friend.
The wedding photos are so good. Blow-up photographers and makeup artists, you're really super professional.
Thank you very much for your patience and diligent teaching. I love the photos taken.
The moment I saw the wedding photo, I didn't recognize myself for a while.
As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have wedding photos that can rival the stars.
What's more important about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and the makeup artist are both aesthetically online. Thankfully, I met.
After seeing my wedding photos, I found out that I was also "cheating".
Asian American groups have complained of discrimination in admissions to 3 Ivy League schools, including Yale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three famous Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian Education Union, which led the complaint, held a news conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukon, the group's chairman, said in the release that the number of Asian applicants who qualify for admission to prestigious U.S. colleges has increased exponentially in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian applicants in the three prestigious U.S. colleges has remained at the same level.
Many studies show that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of enrollment.
Zhao Yukon said that the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in the three colleges and universities, relative to the number of applicants, the admission rate of Asian people was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rates of admission for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukon told the Xinhua News Agency that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice will be able to launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian people in their admissions after finding the facts.
They also expect that the university complained of will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change the admissions policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Coalition was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education failed to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, the participants in the complaint also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant in Yuyao Zhangding Town, Zhejiang Province, from a housing agent. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu held consultations with the family of the homeowner, Lin Mou, on the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted RMB200,000 through bank transfer for the deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Sale and Deposit Receipt", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit goes to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. The parties agreed to sign the contract for the sale of the plant within a week."
However, afterwards, the two sides failed to reach agreement on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the plant sale and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
It's not easy to see the house, the deposit was paid, the house money was ready, and the contract was signed "on the doorstep", but the seller didn't sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and that the blame could not be attributed to the defendant only. It should be reasonably presumed that the consultation failed. Therefore, the penalty for the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for the breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the verdict.
[The lawyer reminds] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise the duty of care and prudence.
When signing a contract, the buyer should perform the necessary duties of careful attention, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and to clarify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when fulfilling the contract.
(German Voice) After the "Summit for Democracy" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Summit for Democracy", which is "to draw the line of ideology, to instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and to fight against democracy in the name of false democracy, to stoke division and confrontation, and to divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concept on others, implemented 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, and staged 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy 'has long been a' weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to intervene in other countries.
The summit is Biden's action to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by video. The leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for the problems of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
And there are also skeptical voices at the international and domestic levels in the United States. For example, the invited participants were criticized for including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some doubted that the Biden administration's real intention was to organize the summit not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
A statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is full of pathologies, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party rivalry, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, and rich and poor divisions intensifying." American democracy is a "game for the rich" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resilient to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must keep it up to date in every generation. In my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "require fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long action after this Summit for Democracy, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let all of us implement our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
OK, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address

What is the red card whisky drinking method?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like to collect, others like food, and of course, others like wine tasting. Red-card whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and red-card whisky has won the gold medal of the International Tavern Competition.
Every bottle of red-card whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it doesn't spoil its mellowness.
So how do you drink red card whisky?
The small part is briefly introduced for everyone.
Red card whisky drinking method:
Johnny's red-carded whisky is made from about 35 Scotch whisky blends, with strong aromas and the qualities of traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoky aromas.
The inlet is fresh, with a slight flavor of vanilla and strong smoky malt.
The wine can be served directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red card whisky has entered the country. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese, red card whisky + Coke or Snowbee or New Kiwi sparkling beverages have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet beverages, in addition to neutralizing the sour taste, can visually bring pleasure to people. Add the beverage, and play a role in diluting the taste of the wine and changing the taste.
Red card whisky + sliced lemon + square sugar (caster sugar is also available), is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic red square is somewhat tart. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste. Lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweet acidity can be blended according to personal taste.
The above three are the best way to drink red-card whisky. You can try it as a reference, and hope that the introduction of Xiaobi can help you.
Thinking about education: How university exams can make "academic bullies" and "academic scum" each get their own way - Xinhua
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leadership, reflecting the confusion about the university exam, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the type of the exam, and let the exam truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On the university campus, students come from all over the world and have different levels of competence. In addition, the degree of study varies, and the situation of study varies greatly.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question is single-type and the repetition rate is high, and the topic is too simple, it will inevitably lead to another very different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the assault before the test. If they think of other ways, they may achieve the effect of double the effort.
In this way, there is a "school slag" that can pass and even score high without input; the "school bully" never fails in class, the homework and notes are good, and the "freak" of the exam is not much higher.
In this view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not baseless in reflecting the problems existing in the university exams, and I believe that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have attended universities are aware that it is not uncommon to surprise the test preparation, think of various ways to "cram" the test questions from teachers, try to draw the scope of the test, and get "key counseling" before the test. It is not surprising even to take a copy in the test, and ask the teacher for high-priced help after the test.
In the author's view, as a guide of teaching quality assessment, the measurement of a university's examination pass or not lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Enter the undergraduate level, the majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not to comprehensively grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the university examination to examine.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of discipline. From the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, but it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being studied, and it is still the focus."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, and does not mean that the exam questions are single and the exam questions are repeated.
In many universities, the exam will generally form a question-making group, and then the subject senior teachers will coordinate the composition of the test paper. The examination papers will also be attended by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the practicalities of teaching and learning. The topics are difficult to be normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the extent of students' learning, so that the test proposition has a dynamic grasp of the difficult and the type of topic, not only to highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also to take into account the examination of competencies, and at the same time to carry out innovative design of the type of topic.
Examinations are the baton of university education. What kind of exams exist, and students will have corresponding test preparation plans. In the long run, they will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's letter of recommendation, the Lanzhou Jiaotong University authorities attach great importance to it and have deployed the rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-inspection of course completion exams, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test paper propositions and examination links, refine the assessment of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanical solutions to the problems of single type of exam questions and repetition of topics are the topics that need to be confronted by university examinations. Of course, a corresponding system needs to be introduced. But kung fu is expensive in everyday life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. It is not only necessary to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation. Eating through both ends, teaching and learning will better interface, form a benign interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the reality, so that the "academic bully" and "academic scum" will each have their own place.
If I can't change the location of the branch, can I change it to delivery?

Lady Kim's Wedding Photography (South Street) There are no branches for now
Before taking the photo, because we didn't schedule the time, we changed the time twice. Lanlan, the consultant, patiently helped us schedule the time.
Later, I chose a good weather weekend shoot.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it's a consultant, a makeup artist or a photographer, are superb.
That's the first time in my life that I'm officially wearing makeup. Wow, I can't believe it. I'm going to look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry I can't remember my name) are super patient in make-up and very natural in make-up.
The location was filmed in Jiangyuan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and it didn't feel very cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headpieces from time to time. When it was a little bad, he helped us straighten it up immediately.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because we see many cases on the Internet, we don't want our guests to delete too many photos. But when we choose photos, really, we don't have the meaning of adding photos at all. Of the 24 photos in the direct package, none are added (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000-plus package. At the time, I was stunned and afraid that I would choose too much)
Today, the photos were repaired, and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and thought it wasn't very good. They immediately helped me to reconstruct them.
Comparing the photos my sister took before, I think our photos I'm really too satisfied with, simple and fresh, is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Mrs. Xuanhanjin to take wedding photos!
Price of sleeve: RMB399
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you sincerely wish you a happy and prosperous future!

3,200 newborn baby unreported raw paper in Sabah due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11 October) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper was running out, it had not been possible to issue the birth paper to the newborn since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people had reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairou Aminus, assured that all infants who have applied for the newspaper paper, the information has been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeiting paper will be reissued when it arrives next week.
At a news conference, he explained the 10-month-old report on the issue of printing newsprint in Sabah, an online media outlet.
He said that the relevant problems arose two months ago, and Sarawak faces the same problems.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers that produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah was different from other regions, so it was not possible to borrow stock from other states.
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it to the printing company on the 8th for some printing.
"The Bureau will send a person to Kuala Lumpur to collect the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that the additional 2 business days (December 20) will be available to the applicant."
"We will tell the applicant to go to various branches to collect the newsprint."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 newspaper raw paper so far this year.
Wait from 7:00 until now
Is that fast approaching?
I mean food
I'm on the other side of #PRS_ORG#
Well, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready

48-hour negative nucleic acid and "buffer zone" The State Council Joint Defense and Joint Control Mechanism issued a letter demanding that the epidemic prevention and control in port cities be strengthened - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Protection and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the coronavirus epidemic in port cities, requiring that those who recently left land border port cities (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) should have a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and that those who went to land border port cities should take at least one nucleic acid test after their arrival.
According to the notification, the time frame of the above-mentioned requirements is from the date of the determination of the port city scope by each province, region and city and the announcement, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also suggested that the port cities with conditions could study setting out epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the region, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing the zoning differentiation management policy, transforming the prevention and control spillover line into two defenses, is expected to realize the forward shift of the gate, compress the risk of the epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum results of the epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many clusters of local epidemics in China, all of which are overseas epidemics imported through port cities.
The above notice points out that this exposes some local epidemic surveillance and early warning not timely, closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing flow in form, cold chain items are not eliminated in place, centralized isolation sites are not standardized in management, and epidemic emergency management is not scientifically accurate.
The notification requirements, from the nine aspects of improving the epidemiological prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemiological monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of the port urban control short board weaknesses, do a good job of prevention and control without any relaxation and scientific precision, and weave and firmly the foreign defense input line.
The notice stressed that the ports and cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and the people's livelihood protection simultaneously, publish and open the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the supply of basic living goods and prices and other emerging hidden problems, and timely solve and actively respond to prominent problems of the masses.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and municipalities directly under the Central Government where the open land, waterways, air ports are located, and the specific areas will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

The truth about the bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military in 20 years from the beginning of the oil pipeline video - Xinhua
(Video: Pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on the pipeline platform titled "The Killing Machine" attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity in 20 years of militarism, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Unmanned aerial vehicles are used to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort humanity, and set up homicide teams.
For 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate the "suspects" in various ways.
A crime against humanity has stirred up hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terror" war "is more anti-terrorist and more fearful".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the United States in the name of "counter-terrorism", and poke the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
inadvertently saw the following article, from the commercial point of view and the preservation period, to talk about why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded area to help do the canning, although the canning is deep processing, not within the scope of the business of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, contacted a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags are identical to the listening milk powder, and their raw materials are not different.
Then you will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags a year, and the shelf life of audition is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the difference between the price of listening and bagging so large?
In fact, many consumers from this point, or mom-grade, think that this is because the raw materials are not the same, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but what everyone thinks is expensive is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or taste of listening attire is not the same after eating out of this mindset.
Now let me tell you the reason for pretending to be expensive, where is it?
Their raw materials are the same Why is the price difference so large?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most take into account that if the pricing of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept them. This means that the profits generated by manufacturers are low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a large margin of increase in the pricing of listening attire to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening clothing, not bagging.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising each year. What's the cost?
You can imagine it.
Then, with the development of society, the marketing costs of the market, for example: the promoters of shopping malls, the display costs of shopping malls, the cost of gifting products, the advertising costs, etc., are also constantly increasing.
So various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it's listening clothing, and its price is constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase of market expenses.
The main purpose is to make higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked to the doctors of the hospital, who assist in the promotion of the products, from a sound inside the profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods and methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bags of milk powder into the tin on the premise that they have a can at home, which can save money, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and it has no impact on small children.
Also, you should not think that the shelf life of the listening pack is longer than that of the bag. If the shelf life of the listening pack is the same as that of the bag after opening the bag, it is only said that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, and is susceptible to moisture and deterioration.

Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhua
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the fervor of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do" before telling you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that it has crossed the "how to do" at once, which is actually the most important and fundamental link.
That's why these books all share a common trait - either do the best in one go, or don't do anything at all; 100 or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" will allow anyone to admit that it is "incredibly right", but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make a determination, make a new person, and have a 180-degree transformation" path, which is precisely the Achilles' heel of many people.
For those who are unconventional, conformist and refuse to change, you must shout "you want to be converted" in his ears. It is undoubtedly a self-deception and a play on the bull.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the word "transformation", wrapped up, and difficult to make up their minds; or with a moment's impulse, they painted the determination of "transformation" and bravely took the first step, but often the good times are short, and they can't insist on losing the battle for a while, and it's hard to see sustainability.
The crosstalk of Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow" is the classic that most conveyed this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, and makes the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way to potentially put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory that "small wins are big wins" - that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes at your door, because it's always stronger than where you are.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than nothing.
Because the threshold is significantly lowered, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything is adhered to.
Just follow the "next-best principle" of the road to success, its journey is only a little longer.
In short, although the "best principle" is on the surface under the banner of making everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire a few; in fact, the "next-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The resource potential of bare carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Liu Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) learned from the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the resource potential of bare carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year from the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
The bare carp of Qinghai Lake, popularly known as "Huangfu", is a unique precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of bare carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as the large number of man-made killings and the deterioration of the environment in the naked carp breeding waters. In 2002, the resource potential of bare carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the bare carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as endangered in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes and fish farms, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for bare carp in Qinghai Lake and major rivers and tributaries in the lake region, and prohibiting the sale of bare carp and its products.
At the same time, the protection of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake has continued to increase through measures such as artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main river channels in Qinghai Lake, and designing a scientifically reasonable "fish passage". The reserves of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, said that to date, the bare carp of Qinghai Lake has cumulatively implemented artificial breeding and release of nearly 180 million tail, and has contributed more than 23% to the recovery of bare carp resources of Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the Three Rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued notices of no-fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and built a comprehensive no-fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

Just saw an article with a fake routine. It's too long.
Give a Cop to a man who doesn't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first official holiday someday between the ages of 13 and 15, and will be amenorrhea around the age of 50.
Then, on the premise of good health, you will come once a month on a more regular basis.
But it's not regular enough to predict it accurately. About a week or so of tolerances need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the luck will flip (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of menstruation vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people a week; some people have less flow, some people have a big blood collapse; some people have no reaction. Some people have pain in the ambulance, and their menstruation will change with time. Previously, it doesn't mean a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation can't be controlled, bleeding for 24 hours in the first few days to the end, and all you can do is suck blood with a sanitary towel or tampon to prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. Eating ibuprofen quickly when the physiological period first does not have time to dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain in the month. Eating it after the dysmenorrhea begins is not helpful.
Pre-biotic period due to uterus congestion and excessive release of prostaglandin, easy to pull the stomach.
If it's about the cycle, inexplicably pulling your stomach, you'll basically menstruate in two days.
Sanitary napkins should best be replaced in two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to breeding bacteria. In addition to the sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month. That's 42 tablets. If you add the pre-prepared portion, there may be 50 tablets, and you don't use one tablet every month.
(Modify it here, the tampon doesn't have to change constantly, it can be changed once in about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body makes a stumble on itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still high, and they don't make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and after that it slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is the house. Every month, the house (the endometrium thickened) is built to greet the guests. The guests do not come. All are demolished (the menstrual discharge) and new houses are built next month, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades on end, bleeding 24 hours a day every month, and low back pain in the abdomen, who wants?
But a person can be born because his mother came to menstruate. The menstruation is to prepare you for 10 months of living in a house when you first came into the world. Everyone should thank their mother for regularly and healthyly coming to menstruate.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed. Society brainwashed women and said it was dirty and shameful. People thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the preparation behavior of women's bodies for life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think about it again. Men who have never experienced it, will not experience it in their lives, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful. How can this attitude be nice to face their mother, and how can it be nice to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which are really good to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival. It's disappointing to send errors
order another meal for the children to eat
I hope that the shops will check the products when they are busy.
Is the foot bath soap leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, Gomez Xiao will answer this question, and hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health consciousness, foot baths are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of different grades of products have emerged on the market. Foot baths from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan are full of products, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data surface, health care appliances such as foot baths sell hot compared to traditional appliances, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in live water!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt numb when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath. He didn't expect to turn off the vibration function, and his father still felt hemp on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, and the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water of the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchants, whose attitude was still good. Despite the withdrawal of the foot bath, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that the foot bath, which has been popular for a long time, nowadays does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, which people is suitable for, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
But in general, the foot bath won't have a live problem, but it doesn't rule out that a few products aren't strictly controlled when they leave the factory.
Therefore, at the time of purchase, choose a split foot bath.
Hydropower is separated, and there are no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pencil.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (Li Jian, photography by Liu Xiaoling, correspondent of all media) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Black Tea Promotion Meeting were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote the tea culture, and accelerate the sprinting of the goal of the 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunlien, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperation, and Ye Hongdi, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, grandly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of the lake is becoming new, and the rise of black tea is injecting new impetus into the "multicolored Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial committees and provincial governments have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion-dollar Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Sanxiang Four Water Colored Tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea types, such as green tea, black tea, and black tea, have worked in turn to promote the integration of tea tourism in the main tea-producing areas, and to drive the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The feng shui turns, and the black tea works.
Tea industry experts in the province said that after harvesting green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea plantations has risen.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the license to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and newly hailed the "Source of the Lake Hong".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants were interested in an alpine tea called "Ice Spring" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Jun, the secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, was pleased to say that the current epidemic and other factors more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there were bright spots.
The new black tea is a touch of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, the popularity is strong, the trade fire, and the Hunan tea industry is happy to welcome a new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be solved directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "Metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "The metaphysical is the way, the metaphysical is the instrument" in the "I Ching • Therapy Upload". It is translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inou (Meiji era) by metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
Ontology is "to study which nouns represent the real existential entity, and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural justification, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Method naturalism, on the other hand, refers to research methods that do not put a word on God.
Spiritual philosophy is the philosophical branch of the study of the essence of consciousness and their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and the flesh.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline that systematically thinks and studies the moral life of human beings; here, ethics is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethics (abstract study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judge a variety of ethical views, and give moral guidelines for correct or wrong behavior.
It examines what style of ethical code of conduct people should follow), applied ethics (applied to academics in real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collected information about how people live, summarized from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the predicted theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice, and examines the ethical outlook held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethics of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethics of the religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli et al., and Modern Ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, represented by: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, represented by: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethic, represented by: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academy ethic, represented by: Kant and Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by: Bentham and Siquiwick et al., British evolutionary ethics, represented by: Spencer and Huxley et al., later in the 19th century, by German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by: Li Keel et al., by neo-Helwaldist ethics
Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retroactive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is the subject of research on the essence of beauty and its meaning.

That's the same as giving it. You're asking for money for a McLean sauce
You asked the restaurant to bring it
I just don't want to go downstairs and buy things to spend so much money on takeaways
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all friends for their humanitarian relief over the 30-year long period after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian relief to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, and so far, the relief has not been interrupted.
Nowadays, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and started employment.
It is your righteousness that has helped our families through the most difficult times.
At present, the new epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have retired each year.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop giving us difficult - Tian'anmen Mother Group humanitarian donations, this humanitarian relief activity is long overdue to draw the perfect end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, and ask my friends to forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
According to: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the history of 32 years of humanitarian assistance by the Full Aesthetics Self Association (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, Full Aesthetics Self Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project's implementers often intersect.

The relief money often can't be delivered smoothly on June 4.
In 1994, upon the recommendation of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of Taoist relief funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "June 4 Education Fund for Orphans", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all June 4 orphans graduated from university, the MCDF then established the "June 4 orphaned elderly special hardship fund", and has been implementing it ever since.
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations in June 4, from generous contributions from individuals, and are supported by the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labour Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, it was difficult for people in June 4 to finally receive a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June 4.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding's call to stop the June 4 donation is for the donor's consideration. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to thank Teacher Ding for his "To Friends" letter.
We will respect the difficult decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would also like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have persisted in generosity and risked delivering humanitarian aid for many years.

Makeup artists are particularly delicate, and will match your makeup to suit your style. Cosmetics are also made with big brands in the first line.
Teacher Tian Liang, let alone, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio is very artistic, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better film buildings in Beijing need to be queued six months in advance. Some of our colleagues filmed in Beijing, and I felt justsoso after watching the next film.
I purposely searched for this studio, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we think that this is also a short version of most people. The photographer Liang Bao will snap and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, late design, a good team.
We and the people around us can't praise it enough.
She's been recommended in the past, and she's just seen the negatives and is just as happy.

How do I give money?
The re-delivered meal has been delivered
No rider receives
Now the restaurant clerk calls me
A little bit of programming that wants to share personal experiences.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have an idea in this regard, it's best to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and you have to take six months to learn.
But if it's going to hit the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, and training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to self-study, but you will be tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will have little meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, explore this training institution before choosing it. It is best to explore the students coming out of this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know exactly how this institution is, and the courses explained are good or not good.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there's no definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, or even in which city, these will have to do with the profession you study or want to pursue.
If you are a student and haven't graduated, or have graduated from computer majors, then if there is enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the least efficient and costly. Nowadays, many offline training institutions are actually very good. However, once the cost of study is high, the time devoted to the second is relatively high. It basically needs to be concentrated for 3-6 months.
But if I say these things, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the network are now free, or there are a lot of training resources to go to Station B. If you don't look for resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is OK.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of money and time cost of study, it is recommended to study in a training institution. This way, it is not very laborious to study. The teacher explained in detail, and there are questions and people specially answered. In addition, it is helpful in the study planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and recommend going to the company after studying, so that the job-hunting interview session can save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions. Since the above said, I don't know your situation, so the introduction is only approximate and not detailed. If you have other things you want to consult, you can always contact me for communication and communication.
I said to arrive before 1:00, and I saw it on the app
What is it?
I haven't finished. What are you doing?
I, undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), fireplace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, hood, lamp fittings, glass wiping, professional sewing, domestic service
Thank you to those who silently praised me. It's tiring to work hard to live but to continue
Life won't fail anyone who makes every effort. Just pay attention to me if you like, and thank those who silently compliment me
That's how life is. Others only see the results, support the process alone. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, but to continue. The way can be looked back, but it can't be looked back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of intent.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up. At that moment, all the tiredness is worth it, and the pay will pay off!

Only by doing it with your heart can you succeed, and by using your meticulousness to mold exquisite, we are serious about beautiful sewing.
Give me the opportunity and will definitely satisfy you, the quality speaks for itself, because the profession deserves to be trusted, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
At present, all walks of life are not good!
But I always believe that as long as I take a serious attitude, persevere enough, and work hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining "!
The plan of the day lies in the morning, all the good things from the morning onwards I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and good intentions, and stay in a good mood all day long.
As a child, happiness is a thing, and it is happiness to have; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, and happiness is achieved; when you mature, you find that happiness is originally a state of mind, and you are happy when you comprehend it.
Be the truest and kindest self, walk with your heart, and have no regrets in this life; live one way, walk one's own path; live two treasures: good health, good mood, and live beautifully until old!
At every stage of life, different problems will be encountered.
Many times, it's not the ability that holds you back, it's the courage to face it positively.
Since it's impossible to avoid, it's better to face it openly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
Exhibitors from China and Saudi Arabia joined hands to hold the first Saudi Arabia Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) - The Diriye Biennale of Contemporary Art, the first Saudi Arabian Biennale of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriye JAX Arts District, located in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriye Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. Tian Feiyu, curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, is the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "Cross the river with a stone", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted in the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of the social and cultural development of Saudi Arabia.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Touching the Stone across the River"; "Inheritance as an Experiment"; "Thinking on the Edge"; "Towards the Public"; "A Beautiful New World"; and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits in this exhibition, including paintings, installation art and performance art in various forms; the work of 12 Chinese artists has also attracted much attention, and some artists have created using recycled materials in novel ways. For example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in "The Story behind the Series of Creek Mountain Endless Pictures" (2014).
Buckley, CEO of the Diriye Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that the Biennale would establish an international dialogue, give the global audience the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's burgeoning cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interactive exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, not only to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale. Artists, curators and creative industry opinion leaders will hold discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of rural public welfare jobs - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng): In order to continuously improve employment assistance for the people who have been lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty eradication, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization of rural public welfare job management, and help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial People's Society Office introduced that at present, a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan for the employment of rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty alleviation labor, and they have played an important role in helping the people who have been lifted out of poverty to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively enhance the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations are jointly issued by seven departments, such as Yunnan People's Society, rural revitalization, and finance, and mainly standardize the target range, fund management, job development, and job management of the grass-roots recruits for rural public welfare positions.
In terms of job development, the new rules are clear, and are set up according to the principles of "post-needed, post-needed, dynamic management, total volume control", "who develops, who uses and who is responsible" and "one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, examination, public announcement, employment, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare jobs, and stipulate that each rural public welfare job development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the rural public welfare job placement personnel; and require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of rural public welfare job subsidies.

Hello
Can an order be cancelled
I re-ordered the order
Whether it's cancelled
Secondly, although the rightists have a winning era in history, they are not long. So, it is short because they give a little sunshine and sweat when they drink a little boiling water.
However, to be realistic, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the cultural revolution to define the truth standard, develop the economy and improve science and technology, and promote the administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be negated.
3. As far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he's serious, he's serious about China and he's serious about China's social problems.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that a revolution is anti-necessary. On the other hand, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed up, and then foreign countries will take advantage of it.
4. Change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country's people. Those who attempt to extract chestnuts from the fire of political speculation are not rightists, but they are jerks.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political outcasts.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's statements and analyze their thoughts when it needs to, so the left doesn't have this makeup, because what the left wants is exactly the dross that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends rebutting the thief's left epilepsy while still moving really, and I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with the Chinese traitor and the left epilepsy. They are a sinus, and can't be reasoned.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone think about letting the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit it, why?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you five hair, when the left epilepsy scolds you right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people also have ideals when they are teenagers. When they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals, but become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually farther away, even the dragon-smuggling teenager ended up as a dragon.
I think that generally refers to restraint and freedom. China's innate gene from history and culture causes China as a whole to be left-leaning.
And the domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, and the left is strengthening supervision, paying more attention to fairness and security.
Now, the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to equity. At the same time, China and the United States are in contention. Left-leaning is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'm done with liking it
Don't say anything, the flowers are just.
In the past two years, the blockade and congestion of Huawei chips by Mei Emperor not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States Emperor suppressed China's chip industry, and demanded that its own enterprises and related enterprises of allied countries blockade China's chip industry at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in lower R & D investment and reduced production capacity of chip-producing enterprises, thus creating a disorder of the shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
Nowadays, "core deficiency" has spread to major industries around the world, such as automobile companies shutting down production and mobile phone prices, and nearly all industries that use chips have been deeply affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chip", more and more countries' tech giants have begun to move to the path of "de-grooming".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and hamper the development of China's semiconductor industry, Lao America recently moved frequently and hosted the "Chip Summit"; it also invited the giants of 64 countries to establish the semiconductor alliance and provided funds to support the local technology giants of the United States. For example, Intel, the veteran technology giant of Metropolitan, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, spent $20 billion to build two crystal circle processing plants in Arizona, United States, and opened up the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to rob TSMC of its "job".
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the United States and the United States, has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large talent pool and technical reserves. It will surely rise rapidly in a short period of time to defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongcou, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongcou was surprising. For Intel's move to invest in building fabs, Zhang Zhongcou said bluntly without care: Intel builds a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongcou is disdainful to Intel's foray into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongcou is still deeply concerned about a feud between Intel and the power supply of the front desk for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the jewel in the manufacturing industry of U.S. Emperor, riding the top position in the world, and being the dominant player in the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been mastered by a few strongmen.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. Chips were completed by a factory from design, manufacturing to testing. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred from facing huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by the market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to see a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongcou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and believed that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specially used for wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongcou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has targeted its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", and does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which was just founded, was a small player in front of the Big Mac of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongcou approached Intel to invest. But at that time, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC was only doing manufacturing in the chip industry, it was clear that some self-esteem was too high. He could not look after TSMC and decisively refused to invest in Taiwan's electricity accumulation.
Zhang Zhongcou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer process services at the time.
I didn't expect to look down on the giants of wafer manufacturing services, but now I'm going to start doing foundry for crystal wafers.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongcou found it ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization exceeds that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally does not dare to stand firm.
Today, TSMC has sprinted toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
No wait
At 19:06, the order was placed for 2 hours.
Today, take a look at some of the "strange hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February, February
They appear to be quite different from the "Evolution Model of Internet Public Opinion" once demonstrated by Netcom.
What is unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, and they showed [lone peaks], [jagged], and [broken cliffs].
[Lone Peak] That is, man-made heating, quickly burst into the hot seat and aroused the public's attention; [jagged] That is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic occupies the hot seat; [broken cliff] That is, collective evacuation, the hot seat has completed its "function", received a new task and dashed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event. The time varies from second to second. It must be that the unified batching army receives the task and starts a new offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot spots are on the list at the same time, which attracts attention, which is responsible for the popularity, which fires the trend, which diverts attention, which affects perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion, which wraps up the decision-making. The black-produced accounts are batch-by-batch and node-by-node, and the battle is refined, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Leaving aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, black PR will also have nowhere to hide from the objective data only.
Anyone who walks past will leave traces, and such traces, we dig them out together.

The first cases of omicron infection have been detected in Mauritius and other countries - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12: Report of Xinhua News Agency's foreign correspondent: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection of the new variant of the virus, Omicron.
Mauritius reported two cases of the omicron infection in the country for the first time on the 10th.
According to Maoist Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; the other infected person was a native resident of Mauritius. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Health Ministry of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of omicron infection had been confirmed in the country for the first time.
The three, all students, returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized as they were mild.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government of Serbia has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive by air will have to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the new Pfizer vaccine in the country.
Malawi's Health Minister Kumbizer Chiponda said on the 9th that three cases of omicron infection had been detected in the country for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing of 12 new positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three infections.

Dame 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at it. At first, my budget was 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
When you come to the store, you start a series of tricks.
I just showed them my household chart for the first time. They didn't go to the field to measure the house. They actually were able to give me a quote that my 135 house of 70,000 can be done. Probably, they showed me their materials and didn't know what brand materials they were.
Their second trick is that you'll drag you to the store and pay the deposit (and you'll never return the money once you've handed it, unless you've had enough experience to fight them).
When I'm hesitant to pay the deposit, they'll invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you today as long as you hand over the deposit.
This is a big pit. I'm an example of being cheated. When my mind is impulsive, I've paid more than 10,000 deposits.
He gave me a lot of problems with the quote 70,000 excluding hydropower transformation, not including any doors and cabinet bathrooms, and these three are the cost of the basement.
They also charge more for their services than other companies.
I lost trust in the company and let me sign the contract without clarifying anything at first.
When I go to them to get money back, they appear very experienced and have a dedicated small team to deal with you.
Anyway, it's a customer's problem and they're totally blameless.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities, and a lot of details, don't want to say it's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because the house my friend sought for them to renovate is also of poor quality, and calculate various expenses for you later.
Daddy of the pit, they are the original deceitful leader decoration, now changed into Dame, as if they have gone out of business and changed into other.
So don't choose such a daddy's decoration company.
Later, when you choose, you will take a look at these consultations because the decoration is not small money.

Okay, then don't cancel the conversation. If you don't refund me in 5 to 10 days, you must do so.

The Gemini meteor shower in the starry sky ushered in a great deal on the 14th - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Yunjian) -- As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will be extremely intense on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the day.
Anju, an astronomer in Beijing, photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the asteroid Phaeton 3200, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomical science popular expert, said that just like the Huan Ren blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release slot" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. Along with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow and colorful, and there are not many firestorms, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely intense around 15:00 on December 14. At maximum ZHR (the number of meteors per hour you can see when the radiation point is directly above your head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index plot.
"Last year, the 'Lok Ying' Gemini meteor shower impressed people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the wonderful degree will be discounted a little.
On the 11th day of the lunar calendar, the lunar phase is convex. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, and the moon will set in the second half of the night. At this time, the radiant points of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours in the second half of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to keeping warm and cold. "
How can more meteors be observed as much as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a high altitude, low light damage, and northeast-facing open field in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and visual observation can be made.
It is important to note that the Gemini meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing it.
Friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous' meteor shower blockbusters', it is best to choose wide-angle, large aperture lenses, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, backup batteries and shutter lines are also essential for stability and continuity. "
Chuo Lipeng cautioned.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
With my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning, there are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of IKEA, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to grow at a high rate.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly reach the eyeball. Compared to the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
Experts of Sisi Laboratory of China's Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Ophthalmologist of Beijing Union He Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions as a crowd.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the price of LCD TVs, at present, the price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually climbs.
What makes laser TV so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technology levels, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV's projection distance is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. The space required is small, and the host is small, with a small footprint.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Coupled with lower heat generation, less loss to the equipment, and longer service life of the TV.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K UHD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring a more shocking audio-visual experience to users.
Talking about pseudo-needs, it's the product of demand subdivisions. On picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video and audio players. If you want to balance the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing it, you can judge it yourself, and you're afraid to listen to one side of the story.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle proximity projector -- laser TV -- has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the optimum design.
In order to block some of the ambient light, the use of a micro-structured Fresnel screen is costly, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I particularly hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflections to the eyes this is good when the selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, must be true LCD TV is also long "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
And, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it won't be like at all.
It is precisely ignored that the hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screen, a large amount of light reflected to the eyes at an angle, that is really uncomfortable.
Photo Visual Aesthetics Photography Preferred Quality Store has no branch for the time being
With the addition of the WeChat appointment date, my sister sent me the optional schedule, and the reply message was more timely ~
I saw the shooting works in the store before going, and it was more of an outdoor wedding dress. The shoot was beautiful, and there were a lot of shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my sister, and very patiently helped me try two sets of my tangled style clothes. Finally, I finalized to start the makeup and styling ~ The photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and also improve on various details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas, what I shot was not the style I wanted, but it should be nice.
After the shooting, the photographer will help select the photos, communicate the late style, and feel very attentive horn.
The repaired piece will take about half a month, sit and wait for the effect ~
The second time, he won the photorealistic meal event ~ most of the clothes in the room could choose a shoot.
Finally, a black gauze skirt was chosen to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours. Makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is his brother after 95. It feels slightly greener. I hope that after the customer shooting motion guidance, I can give more advice. ~ It's very chatty, and the shooting process is relatively pleasant.
Photo Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store Reply
I'm on the homepage, and I'm looking at Queenie.
First, I filled out the name and phone number at the store and then selected the costume. The wedding dress can be selected. After changing three or four sets of clothing, it's still very patient. After choosing it, I put on my makeup for a long time, and my attitude of service is good. After the shoot, I will teach you how to pose and style. It's that I feel like I have a big face. The refinement said that it would be half a month, and it would be sent in three or four days. It doesn't feel like it's any different from the original film
[The environment] is OK overall.
There are a lot of optional clothes.
There are almost three make-up locations, and inside is a photography studio.
[Service] It is very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very careful in teaching you the movements.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make up the shot.
[Experience] It may have been a bit too styled. Originally, the double eyelids were affixed to the triple eyelids.
The eyebrows are also shaved, and it's a bit embarrassing for the everyday ones who don't paint brows.
The photos were given in ten days, but the P-chart effect was not very satisfactory, and it was obvious that the double eyelids were stuck.
Because it's not clear what style to try two sets of results to pick or choose black dress Miss Sister said this set is more Hepburn vintage
After choosing my clothes, I started to make up my hair. The hairstylist and the makeup artist's sister were super patient and satisfied with the results
After getting my make-up done, I started taking pictures of the photographer all the way through the process of directing me to pose very relaxed and harmonious
After shooting, I carefully selected the four favorite sheets when the refined little brother said that within 15 sheets of the ending was very satisfied.
It's been 3 days without a reply... Since your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay the freight every time now
Can you waive it and collect my monthly fee when you're done with the investigation?
Does the small umbrella buy insurance, rely on the chart?
The small umbrella is an insurance broker platform of the Internet.
From the point of view of set conditions: According to the "Regulation of Insurance Brokers Institutions (Revised in 2015)" prompt, those who become insurance brokers must meet three keywords: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last 3 years, and the minimum amount is RMB50 million before they can be established, and they must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very demanding. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength. It should be approved by the national authority department of the Silver Insurance Regulatory Commission (which oversees insurance companies and banks throughout the country), and the shareholders should have a good style. As the small umbrella insurance of insurance brokers, the policyholder does not have to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can achieve them.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star severe disease insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelves and Thai Super Mary 5 Critical Disease Insurance, the claimants and insurers are and Thai Life, Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, and don't need to question its spectral dependence.
From the point of view of the payment model: the products of the Internet platform, because the operating expenses of the business network are less, and the cost of the salesman's wages, the Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the pressure of the policyholder's payment, while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
That's still very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professionalism requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will have a lot of misconceptions. In the health notification and occupation piece, non-insurance practitioners will often add their subjective awareness when insuring, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it. This is prone to many claims hidden dangers, and there is the risk of being rejected.
I myself did insurance phone sales in "Tencent Micro-Insurance" (like a small umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I'm very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, and depends on it. What does not depend on it is people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 6 million yuan of insurance, 6 million yuan of insurance and mobile phones, and 60,000 free sickness insurance coverage. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are negligent, and they will not tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is required to be charged according to the normal rate, ranging from tens to 200. Many customers withhold fees for a year or two to buy what they do not know.
Thought it could cost $1, and the insurance company would pay $6 million (pie in the world).
Free delivery of mobile phones, is the end of the policy number, such as 6666, 8888, this special policy segment only sent, and if the winning text message is sent, they do not redeem themselves, and nobody reminded.
(This is another pit for the policyholder.) It is short-term to receive the 60,000-fold disease coverage free of charge. If you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial risk. In the event of a serious illness, 60,000 can do anything. You can't solve the problem, and later life begins to run naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misleadingness of Internet insurance sales.
So, on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies have a wider range of products, and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and saving 2000-3000 yuan / year on premiums per person.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor the insurance products to the customer. In insuring, I will shop around for the customer, and try my best to obtain the best results of insurance for the customer. After insuring, I will do insurance policy finishing for the customer, and insurance policy hosting, so that the customer can be assured of no worries.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance process after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the insurance policy of the Internet insurance does not have much "ritual sense", it may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is a bit like the general assembly line operation of "telephone sales", but there will be a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, and that is - subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether this "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can be with us for a long time and will also provide us with services after many years?

It's OK to patch up the offer code
No problem. Remember that there is no need to arrange a re-delivery. I have purchased separately and I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we want to put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you should resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friends requests, and then made teasing posts, to the time you tried to post the so-called place of my home and father's name on social media, I've adopted a non-responsive attitude.
Afterwards, you intensified not only to continue to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook with impunity some obscure, humiliating remarks about me, appearance, body, good health, what bed to grow strawberries, whether to insert or not, and other messages. I... also counted.
How do I know later that I received more than one friend sent about your Facebook friend's account uploading a photo of you and a sexual harassment comment.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you didn't converge at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and it doesn't matter what status you are, in our society, it needs to be respected by both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you just care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your graph or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and shape.
I don't even think there's a girl who wants someone to humiliate themselves so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it OK?
I said good, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl will be able to say she's OK after being so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't have even basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice rests in the hearts of the people.
I've cut out some of the messages for you to comment on
There should be no one to impersonate the post you sent yourself, right
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
Will smile

Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng stressed that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, that internal forces are the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and that external forces are the important and breakthrough.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the pandemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and help the green transformation and development of green energy.
The digital transformation needs to participate in the establishment of databases to protect and promote the cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and human conditions of the country, and promote the digital transformation of banks, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country increasingly prosperous.

2022-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-Chinese Communist Party Media Multidimensional Report: The latest news on China-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China; the U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to the U.S. ally and enemy in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the news of the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform", a Chinese think tank, the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier was spotted by satellite near the Barabak Strait on January 9.
The Barabak Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with an F-35C fighter and a CMV-22 Osprey ship-borne transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is now cruising the Pacific Ocean.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan, is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Champlain Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stockdal".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) The U.S. and three aircraft carriers have assembled the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. Navy ship-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam last weekend in a rare visit.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The rare visit to Guam by the US and three aircraft carriers amassing the most powerful weapons around China said that it was a signal to the allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military installations in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshan Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating the capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomersubmarine".
The movements of 14 "thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding the ballistic missile submarines have made the "thunderbolt submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity". This system also includes launch-well ballistic missiles located in the continental United States, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads, such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent meta plunge of 26%, and the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "facing unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today are themselves traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on are Meta's traffic channels, no matter what functional positioning.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps externalize Meta's advertising. Through Meta's advertising platform, it is possible to realize cash.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users' data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google takes another shot, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that make maritime businesses.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several large agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets. Meta is a bypass advertising channel, and most of the money burned goes to Meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can earn a lot of money from bytes in the last two years.
Domestic agents are helping Meta to advertise there, and Meta's performance in Greater China is very good.
I haven't specifically understood it recently, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of the new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, how it expects in the future.
It is clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metaverse's realization cycle is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So these next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's very scenery right now. It also has $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue every year. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet businesses and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily life, and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and so on, in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has little confidence, and between disruption is the blink of an eye.
And the unattainable concept of engaging in the metaverse has absolutely no prospect of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous. That is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name again, and it is the fundamental reason for constantly searching for a new track. However, I think his track choice is wrong. It is a path of no return above which is some of my thinking for reference.
