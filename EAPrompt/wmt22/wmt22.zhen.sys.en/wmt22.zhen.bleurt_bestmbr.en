Students take a lead role in the annual meeting of Zhejiang University, research results make people’s minds open - Xinhua English.news.cn
Wash your hands with air, judge the disease with a breath, and accurately search for the source of the haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of thought-provoking academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research has covered various fields including the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and so on. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at domestic and international level.
Biosensors: Your home health checker
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, and his team demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health status from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone and that after exhaling air, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new type of material, which targets chemical elements, and its keen “smell” enables it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart Surgery Lights: The Doctor's High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The early detection and incomplete removal of many diseases are related to the lights that doctors use in operating rooms."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer examination, if doctors fail to identify all tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light disks that can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow-less rate at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by using water and at the most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have created an “air hand washing device”.
Once we stand on the provided sink, the air will be compressed by our body weight.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
} This way, we can wash our hands clean!”
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption at all, and is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A certificate that I find very meaningful...first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I find important besides the driver’s license!
Let’s popularize it: first aid measures actually means emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, the rescue before an ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency help is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, a brain haemorrhage, or a respiratory arrest, then our window of life will only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him with our professional knowledge, instead of just standing there motionless and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is so terrifying.
“In China, we have official statistics claiming that three million people die each year accidently, the most dangerous of which is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average 15% of people will be rescued.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70 to 80 percent can be rescued, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1 percent."
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Response, said.
If an individual has cardiac arrest, with no breathing or heartbeat, pinchling the person will be of no use.
In order to save the person, artificial respiration and chest compressions are required.
I find that few of us currently have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens it is too late, which is why I appeal to everyone to learn this skill in order to have a timely response when faced with emergencies.
Maybe it might even save someone’s life!
You can register your first aid certificate in your local Red Cross Society training center. I registered at the Red Cross Society Training Center in Zhuhai; there are also discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals that I have to accomplish before I turn 25 years old. It was also a few months ago that I added the first aid certificate to the goal list, but it has indeed been completed!
Then, I will be going to take other certification test; I plan to test a diving certificate. I saw there is also a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu. I seem to need a first aid certificate before I can go for the test, so the first aid certificate is actually quite helpful!

First off, let me start with the conclusion. I personally think that "The Four Seas" is a all-round bad movie in every sense.
But if you say that there isn't a bright spot in this film at all, it may not mean that the soundtrack is well chosen at least.
There are many kinds of bad movies. It’s one that makes you fall asleep soundly in the movie theater, but also one that makes you feel indignant after watching it. “Four Seas” is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can ignite your anger in numerous ways.
Han Han has absolutely great talent when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a gram novel. It is difficult to describe and has many loopholes like the windbreaker on Ma's body.
Even after seeing it, you wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you realize that it is actually a piece of shit.
First let me briefly mention some things that I am having difficulty understanding.
The male protagonist's place of residence is expected to be a small island farther south, where he lives with his grandma.
Her grandma had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast in a minivan to watch the snow.
Elderly people sitting in van watching snow from the south to the northeast??
He and his father were totally happy about it.
And then the old man stopped writing.
When opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the lady and her brother get the business license?
Why is it so easy for the speeding gangsters of the island to close a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped on the side of the road, and no truck drivers could be found around.
This prop feels too obvious.
Why would a young gangster with bad credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't they appeal to the police when faced with loan sharking, in the film, the police even asked if there was any problem?
An adult who knows how to use a smart phone but doesn’t know how to use a key card to open the door at a hotel, then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside his room and sleep for a night?
These kinds of inexplicable plots are present throughout the entire film, and they are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what is worse is the subject matter of the movie, or the fact that the movie has no subject at all, other than a disgusting stitcher.
When the film begins, you think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you may guess that it is an inspirational film, and halfway through watching it you think it may be a drama that shows the difficulty of survival of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don’t even know what you are seeing. What follows is deep doubts about yourself, and why would you go to the cinema to enjoy shit at the big New Year?
To most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, you can add inspiration and comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie can work to achieve success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you have to be honest about the feud between a small town teenager who likes to ride a motorcycle and a girl who is a waiter.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot feature anything that’s contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the role played by Yin Zheng who was able to sing after his new motorcycle got burned down just now) doesn't allow him to open up some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand watching.
As for the heroine, she is not mentally retarded but in some ways she acts like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know whether this is because of her acting ability or if it is the director's request.
There’s one thing that I don’t understand, why Han Han, being a racing driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own films?
Is it possible that such a movie is scheduled in the Spring Festival stalls to create confusion for the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment features and advantages:
Yixin inspection well block brick making machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks, small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are all concave-convex groove structure, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of shaft walls is far superior to that of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combined masonry work is done, the vertical holes and the horizontal holes are connected. After the hole core is being poured, it forms a cast-in-place concrete network structure which plays the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are provided with grooves for inserting reinforcement bars vertically and horizontally, the horizontal and longitudinal reinforcement bars increase the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells constructed using concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, water leakage, etc. The well wall modules have stable mechanical properties, easy operation, and standardized forming dimensions.
The intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module block machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-touch touch-type LCD display, and monitors the entire process of mechanical operation to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic and transporting, and double-cylinder hydraulic and transporting.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, distributing box moves, and the mold box is released and lifted, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically conveyed, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thus reducing the mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well modular block making equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances and hydraulic sealing parts to ensure the stability and reliability of the overall performance of the equipment.
The mechanical vibration platform for well wall modules adopts integral plate steel, and the table top is cut CNC and clamped without welding points, allowing the stuffing box to freely swing and guide, and fully reduce mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the filler and integration are combined to enhance the amplitude, and the integrated, fully-synchronized, table vibration and mold vibration are used to ensure the vibrating effect.
The mechanical vibration excitation machinery of the wall module and the computer automatically control the vibration amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials. The amplitude is adjusted without wear or brake, thus extending the service life and reducing the costs.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system, admitting employees for prospective enterprises - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive the training will have apprenticeship status. After they are enrolled, the pilot enterprises will pre-record them as employees of their units.
The Municipal Education Commission has called for standardizing the recruitment, admissions and employer employment procedure of secondary vocational schools, clarifying the dual identities of the students in secondary vocational schools and prospective employees of enterprises. According to the principle of two-way selection, the apprentices, schools and enterprise must sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who reach the age of 16 but not 18, there are four parties which must sign an agreement, such as apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises, to define the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, rights and interests guaranteed for the on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship system to carry out pre-job training and job-transfer training for employees in cooperation with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent training models.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training plans and formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training schooling system as a pilot period. The internship time of students in the company is determined according to the professional personnel training program and the post-internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, a team-based management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has decided to establish 60 municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches. Each pilot program is about 50 people, training a total of about 3000 students (apprentices).
Following the principle of first piloting and then implementing and gradually advancing from point to area, we will explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and companies so as to effectively improve students’ job skills and increase their counterparts’ employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron’s transmission capability is strong, but most cases are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus Omicron variant causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to a report from the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the coronavirus patients they were currently treating were experiencing milder symptoms, such as body aches and coughs, and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none has yet required hospitalization.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with health problems who would otherwise be more likely to become severely ill due to the coronavirus, he said.
In contrast, he said, during the last Delta outbreak, patients he treated with COVID-19 “had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.”
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.”
In the two weeks following the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other physicians shared similar experiences.
While it may take several weeks for enough data to be collected, doctors' observations and early evidence offer some clues.
According to the report from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the novel coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks had severe symptoms, which is half the seriousness rate in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent coronavirus patients died, while the death rate in earlier outbreaks in South Africa is as high as 20%.
"At this point, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: “It’s still early days and we need to get the late stage data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant strain of coronavirus globally, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Thanks to our supporters today, all 80 boxes have been sent away!

Education Review: What can we do to save the abducted children?
If it is analogous to the famous PSA slogan “No trade, no killing”, then in a favorable environment without the demand of “abducting”, group prevention and control, and anti-trafficking by all people make abductions unprofitable, risky, and expensive and hence, crimes like these won't happen again and again.
Recently, the platform for emergency release of information on missing children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for releasing information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard the name of this app called Reunion, I felt a warm feeling.
The new technology not only has a name “literary and artistic” and is full of feelings, but also employs appropriate information technology, and is practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to recover the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The next step is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated in numerous “big words.”
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
The first priority is to focus on the urgent "rescue" purpose, so the many controversial topics, such as "whether child abductees should be punished by death", can be put off for a while and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot be waited.
Based on the experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to leave the crime site as soon as possible after successful investigation.
Delaying the kidnapping operation for one more minute will probably lead to the child being farther away from the parents and the difficulty of investigating the case will increase by a point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective approaches like the “Reunion” platform that will directly help detect cases and retrieve children.
After all, combating kidnapping is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
In combating crimes and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and their parents, from the improvement of legislation to judicial guarantees to careful law enforcement, it is essential to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak."
In addition, child trafficking prevention, both within families and in society, can be done better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three rested at the train station. Parents were asleep and woke up only to realize that the child was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protective skills, but as a parent of a younger child one should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns between parents or placing children under secure protection are minimal steps for preventing child abductions.
From the other side of the police's fight against abduction and child trafficking, the party buying abducted children should also be paid attention and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China’s “Criminal Law”, the statutory penalty for abducting and trafficking children is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the sentence can lead to death and confiscation of property.
The penalization point is high and the maximum punishment is severe. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
However, many cases of human trafficking still occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts on raising children and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this segment of people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict legal enforcement by officials.
If the “market” for abduction and trafficking is widespread, traders become obsessed with self-interest, constantly innovate means of trafficking, creating a “fighting” situation with law enforcement officers, and anti-trafficking operations will inevitably fall into an inefficient mess.
Therefore, breaking the backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eliminate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two major types: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
Depending on the acidity there are three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with light and pleasant botanical aromas and acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: The acidity is slightly higher but not more than 2% and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity exceeding 3.3% or called “secondary oil”.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades :
Ordinary Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain percentage of virgin olive oil to harmonize the flavor and colour. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is a transparent light golden yellow colour.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): is an olive oil that is extracted from oil residue through the dissolution method and refined.
If you've read the classifications, you may have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You must know that olives are like the grapes used to make wine. Olives from different producing regions and various olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best Growing Places for Olive Oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climate conditions such as soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for olive growth.
Except the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only have sporadic planting in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. have similar climates, as are Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on in the far southern latitudes.
Picking months for olives:
From March to June each year, olive trees bloom and produce fruits. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, and the fruits transition from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The fruit picking season is from November to February (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all oils discovered to date.
The Democratic Summit ends and Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy", convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold a second global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how daunting the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before and as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish the little fire of freedom that burns in the hearts of people around the world and everywhere."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint effort of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent, accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the “Democracy Summit” were defending human rights, solidifying democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including leveraging all the tools the technological revolution has to offer.”
Speaking at the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees of their continued concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China’s ethnic minorities including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has accepted China's rise without having a mechanism in place to hold it accountable," he said.
That’s why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use whatever [resources] we have to ensure the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against CCP threats.
He said: “Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don’t recognise the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is why we have to change.”
During the roundtable discussion on combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values, Tang Feng, member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released the "National Statement" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands on the front line of countering dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experiences on how to fight against the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As democracy in Taiwan is on the rise, we remain firmly in the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of backsliding, with authoritarian governments everywhere rationalizing human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective good.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without having to close down the city, and we can defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves.”
While the second day of the Democracy Summit was in progress, the US Treasury Department announced to impose sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries including China and North Korea that were identified as having severe violations of human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment constraints on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist human rights violations.
I took the photo and uploaded it to you
I know.
But restaurants don’t know why they keep delaying deliveries.
It was supposed to be #NUMBER#
Well I won't call anyway
Do not eat
i will definitely complain
If you can’t deliver it, why don’t you tell us sooner?
Waiting for you so long
No, I did not receive the call

I want to cancel the order

Hello, the chicken salivas provided from the restaurant are raw.
I want to try tennis, but I feel scared that I won’t be able to continue, so I want to find a similar price first for practicing.
Unfriendly. In fact, price tends to be proportional to friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, expensive beats will generally be friendlier than cheap beats. These "entry shoots" are actually industrial waste.
They are so low on intensity that the ball hits the rackets and is very vibrating, hard balls can't bear them and even a pro would have trouble handling them.
The logic and subtext of their existence are—Tennis is so difficult, you know you can’t learn it, and you’re unwilling to buy expensive ones, and be fooled with cheap stuff, so you will not play again after playing twice. In this way, it is cheap and you don’t feel bad about it.
When you can really distinguish the good from the bad, it shows that you have made progress. Then come buy expensive ones from me and I will make twice as much money.
It is recommended to pay a similar price and buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough so they don’t sell for great price. New rackets are just as good at 500 or 600, and second-hand ones are 200. Wouldn’t it be good to own a thousand yuan racket?
It is very friendly to newbies, but once it gets past the newbie stage, it becomes useless. Most people, especially girls, can’t get past the newbie stage.
Order has been delayed delivery multiple times
Could you please help follow up?
Postpone
Thank you
So that means, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place another order next time? Did I ignore the original order?
Hi, ordered the food from this restaurant, but the food delivered was missing a lot and the salivate chicken was also raw
#PRS_ORG# There is no reason to let me pick it up by myself, please cancel.
The order I placed requires delivery and there is no such thing as self pickup.

In fact, there are many things to pay attention to in dressing for girls with a slightly fat body.
The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. The length of the skirts should be approximately within the knees, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will make you feel short and fat.
If you wear it in three sections: the upper, middle and lower parts, it will appear that you are naturally taller. Even if the upper body, skirt and socks are in different colors, it will seem to create a slender feel.
In fact, many dark clothes are the standard items for fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat, and elegant black skirts are also the first option for fat girls.
Wearing dark colored clothes, especially short black skirts, can make you look thinner.
If you have fat calves, keep your socks and shoes from being too noticeable.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To prevent people from giving the impression of being fat when they gaze at your legs and feet.
For girls who are a little bit fat, some tips about dressing well must be shared.
Fat girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts. Also the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirts, it will make people uncomfortable to look at. If your legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind with fine lattices). Choose a printed flared skirt with soft texture, and a top with a swinging collar to hide the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
Fat girls who wear short skirts, should choose a top that is in the same color as the skirt, which will increase the height of your fat figure.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer. This is the best match in summer!
If you are a girl with a fat upper body and thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show your advantages.
An A-line short skirt will make you look slim. It’s more suitable for fat girls. Select a tighter top to create a layered feel that will make you look thinner.
A simple white T-shirt matching a short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls can have fashionable style too.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing properly, girls who are slightly fat will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
After you have made changes in clothing, you also need to exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of a fat girl as soon as possible.😄

Girl becomes an arrow target and raises funds for her sister: "It's okay if it's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of "Hangzhou girl willing to become an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" has made it viral in the circle of friends.
The photos show a girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square standing in front of a big wooden board that is slightly taller than a human being. The words "human flesh target, ten yuan for one arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity leader of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such drastic move in raising funds for her sister, but such behavior was not worthy of advocacy. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl is told to raise donations from street "arrow targets"
In the images posted on the Internet, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large board with the character of "G" on it. The words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow are written in black ink." Another board in front of her has her bank account number, WeChat ID, Alipay account number etc. written on it.
The picture sparked controversy after it appeared online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "begging behavior to attract attention", and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
The police in the Tianshui police station near the incident site told local media that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful looks.
Among them, the girl who is "human flesh target" kept crying, begging passers by to play the game. Another girl was shouting beside her, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now desperately needs surgery fees. Please help.
"We contacted local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity from the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 dollars, we made this action because we couldn't think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the entire process, one of the two girls acted as the target, the other was in charge of the shoot, but they were not involved. During the whole process, no one was found shooting arrows. Some people were just watching and taking a photo and posting it on Weibo.
After identification by the public security department, police determined that the bow and arrows used were not subject to control.
The person in charge said that "this way of soliciting eyeball donations is not recommended".
After being warned by police station residents, she has left the police station.

It's fine. The picture quality of the game is really nice.
What's hot in 2021?
It’s undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think that only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A while ago, there is a very popular article, “Look! The Olympic Games that Project Managers Can Qualify For Gold”, it mentions that the project managers can definitely lead in many projects. No one can match them: Carrying bricks, travelling for business, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers, and fighting fires, backing the blame and making apologies are not a problem.
This article may seem to be a joke, but it also brings out the bitterness of the daily affairs of project managers, which reflects their inability to manage current projects.
Personnel engaged in project management work gradually choose to take certain actions to free themselves from the difficulties in their work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professionals) registrations every year, more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management capabilities through learning.
According to "China’s Project Management Development Report in the Twenty Years, 1999-2019", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of applicants for PMP® test in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people passing PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total PMP® certificate holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year, which means that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to simply copy past “old experiences”. The rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we need to learn and explore the way forward while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can taking the PMP exam ensure smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other relevant knowledge points, but they are still confused when they actually carry out project management.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: Inadequate project management knowledge, solely relying on personal experience, lack of project management theory, and not knowing how to practice; Lack of systematic project management procedures and system support, unable to implement the process at work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delaying the project again and again; the members’ labor division is not very clear and the “old fritters” in the team do not know how to deal with the lack of smooth inter-departmental assistance and communication, which makes the project difficult to come forward.
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers. It has won the honorary titles such as "Chinese Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and brought the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
The "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course is an online fragmented learning method combining the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions for project managers and embark on the advanced road to your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, thus bringing efficient operating results to enterprises.
Let’s see what other students say about this course. The course is not only a professional explanation of the course content that is presented in simple language by our expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei’s R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios from many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students transform their learned content into specific work after class.

This year’s “Double Eleven” Carnival’s national online payment transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety of resale red packets and the eye-catching live broadcast have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people feel that the spending power of the people is getting stronger, but on the other hand, they have to calm down and consider the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Generally speaking, Chinese residents perform better in financial consumption, but there are large differences in different aspects of financial behaviors and skills, thus requiring additional improvements in basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, “one old and one young” will remain the focus of continuous attention in financial education; Nielsen's "Report on Debt Situation of Chinese youths" and "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" issued by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish good and correct consumption attitudes, and actively responding to regulatory calls, taking practical actions to enhance consumers, especially young people, rational consumption awareness.
Over the past years, Home Credit has been conducting comprehensive and diversified financial literacy popularization activities for young groups including college students, and through cooperating with top domestic universities to launch innovation practice competitions and other forms, we have subtly guided the young groups' consumption needs in various ways. It helps them establish rational consumption concepts and rationally plan consumption requirements, thus helping them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends of cultivating reasonable consumption awareness and correct perspective on money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid misunderstanding in consumer lending, so as to avoid affecting personal credit evaluation and future economic life.
Be sure to plan ahead when spending, and make repayments on time and within your means.
If we exceed the due date, the overdue record will be recorded on our personal credit report, which may adversely affect your economic life such as purchasing a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to leverage on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and the constantly updated and iterative financial products to provide consumers with better-fitting and diversified services, constantly assist the public in improving their financial literacy, help consumers develop ideas of rational consumption and moderate lending, and serve as consumers' lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partners.

NDO – Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed’s first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist organisations and having close ties to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously undermined the internal unity of the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait toward "solidarity and stability."
Saudi Arabia reopens its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states' resolution of their differences to restore relations with Qatar arises out of a demand for mutual unity dependent upon national interests and regional stability, aiming to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince’s visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor linking the two countries will facilitate travel for citizens of both countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memoranda of understanding for cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince’s visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and the world’s major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — a deal that Gulf Arab states have denounced as not being able to resolve their missile issues with Iran.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe failure to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activity in the region is flawed.
In a time when nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran have failed to satisfy the wishes of various Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia is conducting direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity and to propose measures to enable its member States to fully cooperate to face common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the supercar exhaust sound is the loudest in Xinshan area!
This car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago—Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is almost 2 million ringgits, the annual road tax is more than 10,000 ringgits, and four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don’t know. The data said that 0-100km/h only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate, and probably by the time my myvi just turns to 30km/h, it’s already 100km/h, eh.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes spread all over the body, and the 6.5 V12 engine clearly seen under the glass perfectly describe the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself and I have compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, and everyone is watching wherever I go, making me feel uncomfortable! (It's actually kind of cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
You need to practice how to get on or off the car, otherwise it will look a little awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the car cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine sound is so loud, that once you get out of the car you will be deaf. (But it is still very cool)
The car is too big, and if you park in a normal parking space, it will be very narrow and you’d be afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when the door opens!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don’t get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome to contact us!

That day, thousands of sports cars 911s and tens of millions of supercars Chirons were crashed in foreign countries in just a few minutes!

Let the spirit of the university resonate at the same frequency with the spirit of the times - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed over a long period of time during a university's development journey, and is the soul of a university.
From ancient times until today, university spirit has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the world’s first university in the modern sense was born, the university has shouldered unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they emerged in the midst of national crisis, whose spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of times, advocating the value of “moral virtue, helping the world, and maintaining peace” and the role of patriotism of “relaunching education and strengthening the country”.
Currently, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education has become increasingly evident. Competition in education, technology, and talents across the globe is becoming ever more intensified. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of “Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines” demonstrates China’s confidence and determination to advance from a major country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, and also puts forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How to endeavor to become one of the world's top ranks within a relatively short period of time and speed up the building of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, while still having a certain gap, and to achieve "overtaking on the curve"?
In addition to asserting our self-confidence in goals, paths and ability, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: first, our latecomer advantage. We will continue to introduce outstanding academic talents from overseas, and learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to realize a significant improvement in the academic level and quality of education. Second, we will inherit the wisdom accumulated by the Chinese civilization over five thousand years to promote the development of outstanding traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and improve our image. The third is institutional advantages. We use the institutional superiority of a socialist nation to strengthen target-driven, synergistic efforts to optimize resource allocation and provide a sustainable and sustainable way for schools to catch up with the international advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to be aware that it is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand schools. Each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while leveraging its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, school running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we emphasize three characteristics in running a school: first, to highlight the innovative and entrepreneurial talent development characteristics, building a comprehensive educational environment incorporating the integration of science and education and school-enterprise fusion, and to form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, to highlight the characteristics of intersecting and converging disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate intersecting emerging disciplines and iconic crossover achievements; third, highlighting the characteristics of university running system and social services, and establishing in-depth exchanges and cooperation between industries, universities, and research institutes, accelerating the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "studying emphatically, cultivating morality, discerning intelligence, and being sincere" and "Hinaden Rivers, instil true and great virtues, open things up for the people and foster a nation and state," together constitute the latest system to express the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, accumulate cultural heights and consolidate spiritual strengths. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mindset of "a world-renowned talent for me use" and reflects the idea of garnering high quality education of people out of school; "Initiative and Honesty" stress the spirit of seeking truth and perfection; the university should understand the cultivation of morality and the tempering of its personality while pursuing truth; "Innovation and pioneering" reflects a spirit of reform and innovation: it includes seeking for knowledge and innovation and research should also be expressed as the reformation and development of the country.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of education.
"Those who are intelligent hear the silence; those who are clear see the invisible".
Chinese institutes of higher education should further base themselves on the overall context of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand higher education’s current orientation and historical mission, and accelerate its progress toward building itself into world-leading universities.
At the same time, adhere to the humanistic concern and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit, the spirit of the times, and the national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing an inexhaustible driving force for realizing national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

Guangxi university students could take leave from study for up to five years to start business - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19 (Reporter Zhang Ying) A reporter recently learned from the Education学院 of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that future universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible educational system by relaxing the time limit for school students to suspend study and start entrepreneurship. The suspension period for students in schools may be extended by 2 to 5 years on the basis of their original educational structure and the time spent in studying and entrepreneurship can be regarded as time for practical education.
In order to enhance the entrepreneurial and innovative capabilities of college students, Guangxi’s education, human resources, social organizations and other departments have joined forces to build an entrepreneurial platform, and to build more off-campus practice teaching bases for college students, university science and technology parks, college students' entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurial incubation bases to provide external guarantees for college students to start their businesses.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in universities and colleges should reach more than 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 2,000 square meters for higher vocational schools.
The government encourages colleges and universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits and gives priority to support students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to transfer majors.
College teachers should have at least two months of training at industry companies every two years to enhance teachers' awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Education Department of the Autonomous Region requires all colleges and universities in Guangxi to implement the in-depth innovation and entrepreneurship training plan for college students and strive to make every college student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their stay in school.
Colleges and universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.
NEWS GOV-MO: UM awards honorary doctorates to seven distinguished individuals

At a time when NFTs were quickly out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic have begun to earn stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds US$8.2 million, nearly equal to “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has delivered a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of the blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend’s stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of the companies on the track, which means the choice of the investment target industry. First, I must choose an industry with a large room for growth, at least a market size of 100 billion or more; secondly, I must choose an industry that has good future growth potential, and consider the industry with the best growth rate in the next 3-5 years; ﬁnally, choose industries that have policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the industry's competitive landscape.
Cheer on the right tracks!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics are all about ‘doing the things right’, which means doing things right.
The strategy is to “do the right thing,” which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding the direction, and tactics is about landing. On top of most tactical thinking there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether to continuously deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking). For example, on improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve correct campaign goals such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers. On enhancing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years into its existence, Bitcoin will reach several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, a small Central American country, El Salvador, designated Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares' launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing in the American capital markets, once again expanding cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian American groups file complaint against Yale and three Ivy League schools for admissions discrimination - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College — discriminated against Asian applicants during their admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, the group's chairman, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious US universities has doubled, but in these three elite American schools, the Asians' percentage has remained basically the same.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges “persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “universal” admissions processes.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth have the lowest admit rates for Asian-American students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas on Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after filing a complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice would launch an investigation, and take steps after the fact was determined, to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also expect that the colleges receiving complaints will take the initiative to take this issue into consideration and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities subject to complaint have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance, founded in 2015, filed a complaint against Harvard College for admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, those involved in the complaint also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.

Do you have a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Mr. Lin, a family member of the owner of the building, on the details of the purchase of the factory building and then remitted 200,000 yuan via bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on a "Plant Sales Deposit Receipt", which states, "If the buyer does not wish to buy this plant, the deposit goes to the seller. If the seller is not willing to sell this plant, then the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. The two sides agree to sign the plant sale contract within one week."
However, both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the major contract terms including the scope of plant sales, payment method, etc., hence delaying the signing of the residential housing sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contract content, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally paying the deposit and having the payment ready, the owner finally settled the house and agreed to sign the contract, but the seller refused to sell. This caused Mr. Lu to feel helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People’s Court.
After hearing, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract. The blame cannot only be on the defendant, so it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation has failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for deposit shall not apply in the case, and the defendant is not required to bear the liability for breaching the contract by returning the deposit double.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer's Reminder】You must exercise the necessary prudence and care in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, a buyer must exercise the necessary obligations of due diligence, such as checking the owner’s information, whether the house is occupied, etc., and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the two sides when implementing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Saturday (December 11) that the United States was holding the "Leaders' Democratic Summit" to "draw lines with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and under the pretext of dissimulating democracy, it goes against the truth of democracy, incites splits and confrontation, and diverts domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the US to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden’s move to fulfil his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video and invited leaders of 111 countries around the world, including leaders from Taiwan. China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was unqualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States. For example, people who were invited to attend the summit include some leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some doubt that the real intention of the Biden administration is not to organize this summit for democracy but geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German chancellor Scholz also attends the video democracy summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry’s statement on Saturday stated that “the sickness of American-style democracy is fully manifested today, as the problems of money politics, identity politics, party antagonism, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and divisions between rich and poor are becoming increasingly severe.” American democracy is a”rich man’s game” built on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the force of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not something to take for granted: "We have to renew it throughout every generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our times."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "confront persistent and worrying challenges; democracy requires warriors to defend."
The United States has pledged to follow the Democracy Summit with a year-long campaign that will include a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions ahead of a physical democracy summit scheduled for late 2022.
"Let all of our nations follow through on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.

Richang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Environment: Moderate [Serving Bell] Service: the food comes out very fast. “Ancient Malala Cake” was my staple order. The mala cake is too fragrant, soft, and tasty 😋 Friends who like desserts must try the “Dongjiang Cuttlefish Smooth and Stuffed Bean Curd Pot”. The soup is delicious and the tofu is tender.    …
Great taste, good meat, nice service
It's been a long time since I came to Richang. The fruit scramble is still tasty and full of real ingredients. It is my first time to order barbecued pork buns, which I like with the southern taste of soft flour!
The claypot rice is well-dry and moist, the portion is very generous, the signature tinfoil chicken wings are outstanding as always, the soup is also good, the kale is also well handled...
Great taste, good service, good meat
The old store in Richang was also an internet celebrity many years ago. It’s a small building in Dongdan and has wooden floors.
You always have to wait for a long time to get the claypot rice. The claypot of claypot rice is cracked....
I haven't gone to Richang for several years, and the rise of Cantonese cuisine in various small restaurants has dispersed the flow of customers.
It is rare to see a seat as you arrive in the establishment. The quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Great taste, good meat, good main food
Richang takeaway.
[Rice] Meal: This time’s dishes were a little bit disappointing.
Three Cup Chicken: A little more side dishes and a little less chicken.
The main taste is a little off, the bottom taste is not salty enough, which highlights the sweetness, we can make up for that with sweetness + various spices on the side dishes...
How to drink red label whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like collecting, some people like food, and some people like wine tasting. The Red Label whisky is now one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries. Moreover, the Red Label whisky has won the gold medal in the international wine competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don’t know how to taste it you're just ruining the flavour.
So what about red label whiskey?
Let me give you a brief introduction.
How to drink red label whiskey :
Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey is blended from around 35 Scotch whiskies, has a strong aromatic and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics, a rich aroma with sweet and smoky character.
The entry is full-bodied and refreshing, with hints of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavour.
This wine can be enjoyed straight on ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red brand whiskey has been introduced into China. In order to meet the taste of the Chinese people, sparkling drinks such as red brand whiskey + Cola, Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing sour taste, can visually bring pleasure to people. When added to drinks, they have the effect of diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar is also available), is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic Hongfangwei tastes a bit sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon will bring fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red brand whiskey. You can try it out as a reference. I hope my introduction can be helpful to everyone.
Educational thinking: How to make the "student masters" and "educational scumbags" have their own proper places in college examinations - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leadership reflecting their confusion about the university exam and proposed improving the difficulty of the exam and changing the types of exam questions so that the exam can truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a “hot topic”.
On a university campus, students come from all over the world, with varying ability levels and, combined with their different levels of learning, learning situations vary vastly.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when evaluating groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, with a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the test through a concentrated attack before the exam. If they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a “strange situation” where “students” usually pass the test without putting in effort, and even get high grades; they never drop classes, their homework and notes are extremely good and exams are not much better.
From this point of view, students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University report that the problems in university examinations are not without reason. We believe that this situation does not only exist at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I want to pay praise to these three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, everyone who has attended college knows well that it is not uncommon for people to make surprise preparations for exams, try to use all kinds of methods to “take” exam questions from teachers, try to classify the scope of exams, and get “key tutoring” before exams. It is not unusual for them to include cheat sheets during examinations, and to ask teachers to show their respect after the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a guide for evaluation of teaching quality, measuring the success of a university examination depends on the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning as well as the scientific propositions based on them.
As students enter the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided and many major courses focus on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether or not you have a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is something to be examined in university exams.
Undergraduate knowledge essentially consists of basic theories and common sense of the subject. From a knowledge point of view, there is little room for change and is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, “Twenty years ago, we learned the basic knowledge of university mathematics, but we still learn it today and that remains the focus.”
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, examinations usually consist of question groups, which are then organized by senior teachers of the subject to form examination papers. Exam grading is also completed by all teachers responsible for the subject. This way, to a certain extent, the duplication of test questions can be overcome.
However, we need to draft a set of test questions, which are consistent with the actual circumstances of teaching and learning. The degrees of difficulty are normally distributed based on the overall condition of student learning. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze students' learning levels, thus making the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type. It can not only highlight the basic knowledge inspection, but also consider the ability test, and at the same time innovatively design the question types.
Exams are the baton of university education. Whatever kind of exam there is, students will have corresponding preparation plans. If things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the suggestion letter from students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination on end-of-course examinations, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of test paper propositions and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen overall assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Mechanistically solving problems like single type of test question and repeated topics are issues that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding system should be introduced, but the efforts are costlier in daily life, and teachers need to have comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the student's learning situation. If you understand both ends, teaching and studying will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the examination will variety more according to the reality, so that "student masters" and "learning scumbags" each have their own right.
If the branch location cannot be changed for me, can I do delivery instead?
So I don't have to give additional money, right?
The coworker's order has been delivered

Where is the GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street Branch) has no branches yet
Before taking the pictures, we changed the time twice because we had not arranged the time correctly. Consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
I chose to shoot it on a weekend with nice weather.
Mrs. Kim's staff, be it consultants, makeup artists or photographers were amazing.
It was the first time in my life that I had to officially wear makeup, and wow~ I can't believe I would be so good-looking one day lol.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember her name) are super patient with makeup and the make-up is very natural.
The outside scene was shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was great that day and I didn't feel it was too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and if there was a little problem, she immediately helped us clean it up.
The photographer is also very humorous and had a good time taking pictures all day long.
When choosing photos, because I saw lots of cases on the Internet I was not willing to let customers delete too many pictures. But when we chose photos, we didn’t really want to add photos at all, so he didn’t add a single out of the 24 photos in the package. (I heard that my cousin, who had taken wedding photos around the same time as I, added more than 10,000 photos to the package of over 7,000. I was shocked at that time. I was also afraid that I would choose too many pictures.)
I repaired the pictures today and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at two pictures and felt they were not very nice so they immediately repaired them for me.
After comparing the pictures my sister took before, I feel that I am really satisfied with our pictures. They are simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos with Mrs. Xuan Han Jin!
Set price: 3999 yuan.
Mrs. Jin would like to thank you all and sincerely wish you happiness and a bright future!
How much is this set?
What conditions must be met for $32 to be used?
That is fine, no refund needed

3,200 of Sabah newborn babies had no birth certificates as special anti-counterfeit paper was out of stock
KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah National Registration Office stated that due to the lack of stock of specially-made anti-counterfeiting papers, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, with a total of 3,200 people affected so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Kerou Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their details recorded in the system, and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained a report by an online media that there was a 10-month-long problem with newspaper printing in Sabah.
He said the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in shipping to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah’s birth certificates is different from that in other regions, and therefore it is impossible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing.
“The bureau will send people to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and then go back to Sabah to complete the final printing. It is estimated that it will be delivered to applicants in 2 more working days (December 20).”
"We will inform applicants to go to local branch offices to obtain the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waited from 7pm till now
Is that做好 coming?
I mean food
I'm waiting again across from #PRS_ORG#
Okay thank you, because the restaurant says its ready
Commentator of the People's Daily: "The 14th Five-Year Plan" has achieved a good start — on studying and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11. Commentator’s article in People’s Daily on December 12: “The 14th Five-Year Plan” achieves a good start - On learning and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference
"The 14th Five Year Plan is off to a good start." The Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th spoke highly of China's economic and social development achievements over the past year.

The Party and the country have made new major achievements in various undertakings.
An important aspect of the 14th Five-Year Plan is that it has made a good start in building a new development pattern and achieved new results in high-quality development.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain a global leader position, and the characteristics of strong development resiliency, big potential and sufficient impetus continue to show. The national strategic science and technology force is accelerated, major innovative results have emerged, technological innovation capabilities have continued to improve, and key core technology breakthroughs have been achieved; industrial chains have been improved, foreign trade volumes have also improved, the structure has been further optimized, and innovations represented by new industries, new formats, and new models have grown and expanded; reform and opening up has been advanced in depth, efforts to break down barriers that restrict supply-demand adaptation and factor flow, and secured, high-level, sustainable development of the economy and progressive contributions to ecological development.
These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CPC) with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the scientific guide of Xi Jinping's ideology on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and the results of the joint efforts and hard work of the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country.
Practice has once again proved that the Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping's central leadership and core status of the entire Party and the guiding position of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is of decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country in the new era and for enhancing the historical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping at the center of the Party Central Committee and the core leader of the entire Party at the helm, with the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and the unity and perseverance of the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups, we will be able to overcome various difficulties and obstacles, create new era glories, and forge new historical achievements on the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way.

We will maintain a stable macroeconomic market, keep the economy running in a normal range and maintain a positive social overall situation. We will be able to maintain a stable and healthy political environment and a clean and healthy economic environment for the party and the people.
Let us unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, strengthen the "Four Consciousnesses", strengthen the "Four Self-confidences", achieve the "Two Maintenances", and continuously enhance the ability of political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution, take practical actions to implement the Party Central Committee's decisions and arrangements and continuously push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

Super convenient, just like opening it on a computer, it solved the problem of insufficient hard disk in my computer.
The brand new solid state mobile hard drive that just arrived today cannot be read by a portable solid state drive computer, and the mobile solid state hard drive computer can’t recognize it but the computer using a USB flash drive can read it.
The machine is light and easy to operate and has a sleek and beautiful appearance.
I used it for an afternoon today, the heat dissipation is very good, and I never seem to feel any heat, it runs fast, and can kill 99% of the users instantly when starting up.
The battery is also very strong, with 9 hours of standby time and 4 hours of usage there should be no problem. In a word, I am very happy to buy a machine of this quality at this price, and other features will be added later as I discover them.
Looks quite nice.
Regarding performance, we will evaluate it after a period of time.
The machine is faster, bigger than expected, and the rendering effect is awesome. I like it. I will review it after a while.
Yes, that's good, the serial number of this machine was found on Hong Kong**, and the quality should be OK.
**It doesn’t feel giant, but heavy. It’s not a big thing to grab with one hand. It’s a little bit larger than 15.6 inches but it runs very stable and doesn’t feel stuck. I love the sound of cooling fan, it feels great, and it doesn’t keep spinning like a gaming notebook.
The products are quite good, a lot cheaper than the official flagship store, and a backpack is included, which I think is pretty good.
The store's service is also good, reminding me to update the bios and issue ** in a timely manner.
Its worth it!
Cooling effect: Very good heat dissipation, basically no heat. Thin and light: easy to carry. Appearance and material: Traditional Thinkpad design, satisfactory
Reputable seller, check carefully the appearance of the entire machine and all interfaces, no traces of refurbishment or use, it is indeed a brand new US version machine, the configuration is the same as the page.
Forgot to send out the backpack, so I immediately gave me a replacement one. Although it is not the standard original one, however, the follow-up service is enough to prove that the seller is a conscientious seller.
If you have a friend who wants to buy a laptop, buy it again.
Appearance material: Atmospheric appearance Display effect: The screen resolution is OK, clear, light and thin: It has more texture. After all, the heavier the thing, the better it feels.
Heat dissipation effect: I just tried it at the beginning and will evaluate it later.
The keyboard is very good for typing, and a mouse and converter are also provided. This configuration is still very affordable compared with the National Bank. Generally speaking, it is cheap and beautiful. The performance of the machine will be evaluated after using it for a while.
This screen is really cozy!
It's very smooth to use and I will review it again after some time!
Education information: Beijing reduces the ratio of students with special abilities entered in junior high schools in 2016 - Xinhua English.news.cn
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination work for special students enrolled in junior high schools in Beijing was organized and implemented by the education committees of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced their enrollment ratios for special students, and competition for outstanding students has become more intense.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Chairman: I firmly believe China has the ability to host the Winter Olympic Games during this extraordinary period - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 - Bosnia and Herzegovina Chairman of the Olympic Committee Kvesic recently expressed that Poland is very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and firmly believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics in a special period.
Recently, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with Chairman of the Bosnian Olympic Committee Kvesic at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvecic positively spoke of Poland-China relations and said that he visited China on the occasion of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. He was very impressed by the excellent organization work of the Chinese side, and firmly believed in China's ability to hold the Winter Olympics in a special period. The Polish side looks forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing and participating in the conference. Poland hopes to use this as an opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Ji Ping said that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond."
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in just two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting a simple, safe and exciting event to the world.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in preparation of winter sports tournaments and athletes' training, the Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role and take the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to deepen cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, allowing the two peoples to "project into the future together" and wish Bosnian athletes for success in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" awards ceremony and Ji Ping, as a special guest, presented awards to the best young athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Nucleic acid test negative for up to 48 hours and "buffer area" established; the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document calling for strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia in port cities. It requires that personnel who have recently left the port city (excluding those connecting to Hong Kong and Macau) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who travel to the land border port city should carry out at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date where each province, region and city determine the port city scope and announce it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities may study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to an official from the National Health Commission’s Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar for the local area, with frequent exchanges between border residents from both sides.
Implementing a differentiated management policy across regions, shifting from one defense line for spill prevention and control to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of outbreak spillover, and achieve the greatest impact on epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimal social cost.
Recently, multiple local clusters of epidemics have occurred in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this has exposed issues such as inadequate monitoring and early warning of epidemic in some localities, lack of implementation of closed-loop management of people in high-risk posts, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items, incorrect management of centralized isolation places, and inaccurate scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to focus on nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, speed up to make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses of prevention and control in port cities, do a good job of prevention and control without easing, scientifically and accurately, and tighten the strong lines of defense against foreign imports.
The notice emphasized that each port city should simultaneously research and deploy the epidemic prevention and control work and people's livelihood security work, publicize and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and proactively respond to outstanding issues reflected by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities mentioned include the counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (districts, prefectures, alliances) and municipalities where the open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and will be announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video shows the truth about the U.S. military's bloodthirsty killings over the past 20 years - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source:Youtube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled “Killing Machine” on YouTube attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States starting the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing 20 years of military violence, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocents, and various crimes against humanity.
They use drones in raids on civilian places such as hospitals, schools, etc., distorting human nature, and creating murder teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has murdered tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have stirred more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American-style “anti-terrorism” war “will cause more terror”.
The war did not bring the hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people but only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let us unveil the truth about bloodthirsty killings in the US in the name of “anti-terrorism” and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally stumbled across the following article. It talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to help with canning from a commercial and shelf life perspectives, although canning is a deep-processing business and does not fall within the scope of operations of the bonded logistics company. The following text might explain why the client wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged milk powder and canned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags is one year while the shelf life of cans is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that because the raw materials are different, the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are same, but most people think that the expensive ones are the better ones.
There are also consumers who have this attitude and they will say the taste or taste of the cans is different after eating them!
Now I would like to talk to you first about the reasons why listening devices are expensive. Where are the prices?
Why is there such a large difference in price for the same raw materials?
Most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit. So what can the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So, they now have a big increase in the price of their cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging instead of bag packaging.
Also, you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions in advertising fees each year. Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then, with the development of society, market promotion expenses, such as sales staff in shopping malls, exhibition fees at shopping malls, gift fees for products, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, especially if they are canned, and their prices are also increasing. In fact, these are new products that come out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the additional cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that use all possible means to promote their own products. They are linked with the doctors in hospitals. They will assist in promoting the product and take a profit ranging from RMB30 to RMB80.
But China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow the aforementioned methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy the milk powder in bags and put them in the cans if you have a can at home. This saves costs and increases the preservation and sealing of milk powder. This will not have any impact on the children.
Also, don't think the shelf life of cans is longer than those in bags. If the shelf life of the cans and bags is the same after unpacking, it's just that the bags will not be easy to store after they are opened, and will tend to be deteriorated due to moisture.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and it became dry and hard, making it impossible to eat at all
And the soup spilled out

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful study books.
Many of today's success books promote “best practices” – first assuming or implying that you can “do it” and then tell you the “what” of what needs to be done.
It amounts to saying that we have skipped over "how to do it?" the most important and fundamental part.
Precisely for this reason, these books have one thing in common – either do it as best as you can or do nothing at all, either a 100 or a 0; you either climb Mount Tai or you simply stay put.
This "best principle" can be admitted to "extremely correct" by anyone who looks at it, but 99% of the people will be frightened at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you must make up your mind, become a new person, and make a 180-degree transition”, which happens to be the fatal weakness of many people.
To someone who sticks to the rules, follows convention and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear. This is undoubtedly a deceitful act of deceiving oneself and others.
Most people would be timid in front of the word “change”, hold back and they have a difficulty in making up their minds. Or they will use a sudden impulse to make the decision to “change”, and take the first step courageously. But it is usually a short-lived situation. After a while, they fail, and it is hard to see continuity.
Mr Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that expresses this "universal human nature" most vividly.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limitations of ordinary people’s ability, making most people "sigh with awe."
Perhaps the “second-best principle” is an approach that may put more ordinary people on a path to relative success.
The core of “The Next Best Principle” is to “lower the threshold” - what it encourages is a kind of “small wins makes for big wins” theory, that is, if you cannot do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you don’t get to Mount Tai, you can just climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, there are more chances for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one persists in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It’s just that the road to success following the 'second best principle’ is a bit longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of enabling all the people to succeed, ultimately it can actually inspire only a few, while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
So do I need to re-order now?
Call goes unanswered
NON STOP DELAY
not delivered yet
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How can I get in touch?
please cancel your order
I can't wait any longer, thanks

I'd like to ask, how can I contact the rider?
The first rider told me just now that there should be another rider coming along.
The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increases by 7,100 tonnes this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year to 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection period in 2002, the cumulative increase was more than 40 times.
The common name of Qinghai Lake naked carp is "Huangyu", which is a unique and precious species of fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining the security of the "water - fish - bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human-made mass killings and the increasingly degraded aquatic environments for breeding naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the “Red List of China’s Species”.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp on Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers leading to Qinghai Lake water, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the protection effort has been continuously strengthened, and the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially proliferated and released in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the recovery of the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource exceeds 23 percent.
The Three River Source region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area controlling the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three River Headwaters and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain biodiversity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has recently issued announcements of ban on fishing in key waters of Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has set up a comprehensive management system of “one river, one river and one lake”.

Just saw an article about the menstrual period. It is too long.
Let me give some information to guys who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period someday between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea will occur around the age of 50.
From then on, provided you are healthy, you will come here on a regular basis once a month.
However, it is not regular enough to be able to forecast accurately. There is a tolerance of about a week and need to prepare in advance. Sometimes because of bad luck, the car will roll over (suddenly be several days ahead of schedule).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some people have less flow and some people have massive bleeding; some people don’t respond; some people feel pain until they are taken away by ambulances. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. The pain in the past does not mean the pain in the entire life.
Menstrual periods are uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours over the days from the beginning to end. The only thing I can do is suction blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent blood coming on my clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen in a short period of time whilst beginning the menstrual period can effectively relieve pain of that month. It is not useful to take it after the menstrual cramps start.
Before the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If during the cycle, you have unexpected diarrhea, generally menstruation can happen within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise, they are likely to breed bacteria and eliminate sleep time. In a worst-case scenario, they may need to be replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which means 42 pieces. If you add the amount prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, rather than one piece every month.
(Modify it here. The tampons don’t have to be changed often. They should be changed every five to six hours, a maximum of eight hours)
During the menstrual period, hormonal troubles may be more violent, and during the ovulation period, the mood will be unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which means that it is very unlucky, and the body makes trouble for itself.
But official crime rate data shows that women’s ability to control emotions is still very high, and they won’t use emotional problems as excuses.
It’s not just the blood that is flowing, it contains the shed lining of the uterus.
The endometrium after menstruation is the thinnest, and gradually thickens after that. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Each month a house will be built (the endometrium becomes thicker) for welcoming the guests. When the guests do not come, they will be completely demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house will be built next month, and again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, I’ve been bleeding for 24 hours a few days a month, and still have abdominal pain and low back pain. Who would want it?
But a human being can be born because his mother has menstrual period. Menstruation is to prepare you for being in the house for 10 months when you first enter the world. Everyone should thank your mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into being dirty and shameful. Everybody thought that was like that, but times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and that women's body is disgusting for the preparations they make for life, they shouldn't say it in public, girls stand up, stop thinking about it, men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't understand anything very well, don't be so ungrateful and not knowing what the hell will be, how can I be so embarrassed to face my mother and want my child through such an attitude?
Finally, sisters, let’s try tampons, they really work!
Today is Winter Solstice Festival, so it will be very disappointing if you send it wrong.
Please order extra meals for the kids
I hope that the store can check the product while it's busy.
Are my feet numb in the foot bath tub due to a power leak?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot health care. Today, the GoMe editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the strengthening of people's healthy awareness, foot bathtubs are more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged on the market. The wide variety of foot bathtubs ranging in price from more than one hundred yuan to over a thousand yuan has given consumers a lot of choices.
Related data shows that compared with traditional home appliances, health appliances like foot bath tubs are enjoying rapid sales. However, there is no special industry standard for foot bath tubs, therefore, there are certain safety hazards.
“It is quite dangerous to soak your feet in the charged water!”
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but the soles of his feet felt numb while soaking his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath tub. Unexpectedly, after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in the soles of the feet.
Mr. Li tried it out with the electric pen and it actually came on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that there was electricity in the water in the foot bath.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant’s attitude was good; even though he returned the foot tub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that this already popular foot bath has no clear detailed industry regulations regarding the maximum temperature settings, which groups of people it is suitable for, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, there will be no electrification issues for foot bath tubs, but it is not ruled out that a few products are not strictly inspected when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bathtub when purchasing.
The separation of water and electricity eliminates any safety hazard.
You can also take the test with a pen.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair opens – View the article – Hunan Daily Network – Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily December 10 (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and speed up the pursuit of the 100 billion tea industry goal.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, put forward a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of Huhong is Xinhua, and the rise of black tea introduces new momentum into “Colorful Hunan Tea”.
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100-billion Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, Five Colored Tea".
Tea sector in the province is stepping up innovation and the main tea types like green tea, dark tea and black tea are taking turns to develop, and the main tea production areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, which will drive the majority of tea farmers to increase their incomes.
Fengshui is changed and black tea becomes powerful again.
Experts from the tea industry across the province said that after picking green tea and collecting black tea and dark tea, tea farmers are earning income all year round and the tea garden output value has soared.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders granted licenses to the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua joyfully promoted "The Source of Lake Red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high-mountain tea called “Bing Lichun” and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that factors such as the current epidemic are affecting the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but judging from the tea expo scene, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea has a red touch, infused with tea culture connotation, which is highly popular and hot in trade. The Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods aren't hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up as there was no parking below.

The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is taken from "the Book of Changes·Xishixang", "The metaphysical is called Tao, and the physical is called equipment", which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns merely represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism represents the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the way of research that leaves no mention of God.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of the moral life of human beings; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct agreed upon by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into meta-ethics (which abstractly studies the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (which assesses different moral views and gives moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior.)
It studies what style of moral code of conduct people should follow), applied ethics (the science that applies ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collects information about how people live and summarizes them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics proceeds not from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the ethical factors that drive such decisions, and it examines the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part one: Ethical thoughts of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part: The ethical thoughts of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part three: Ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17 to语八 Century: British empiricist ethics, representative: Hume, etc., 17-18 centuries: European rationalism ethics, representative: Spinoza and others, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German academic ethics, representative: Kant and Hegel, 18-19 century, British utilitarianism and others.
Logic is a discipline that studies “principles and standards for effective inference and proof.”
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject that studies the nature of beauty and its meaning.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all our friends for their humanitarian aid over a long period of more than 30 years after our relatives died. In particular, since I issued an appeal for humanitarian aid in my own name to friends both at home and abroad in early 1994, the aid has remained uninterrupted so far.
Now most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started their own families and have jobs.
It was your acts of generosity that helped our families in distress through the hardest of times.
The current coronavirus pandemic is raging around the world and most of the donors have already retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop your donations to our relatives - Tiananmen Mothers group. It is already long overdue for this humanitarian aid activity to come to an end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your actions will forever be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand, friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Taoye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid between the IFCSS and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian aid, the IFCA and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.
(Apple Daily photo: The Tiananmen Mothers' website is managed by Taoye.) pic.twitter琴com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often fail to reach the families of victims of the June 4th incident.
In 1994, upon suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan’s Education Fund”; 11 years later, in 2009 when all June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF further set up “June 4th Orphaned Elderly and Specially needy Household Relief Fund,” which has been implemented till today.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations during June Fourth, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It was not until last year that after a lapse of 31 years, the families of those affected by the June 4th Movement finally received a donation from Hong Kong that had been raised in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped June 4 donation for the sake of donors. We are all retired seniors, and their income is not as abundant as before retirement, so we would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his letter “To Friends”.
We will respect the families' decision to terminate the program within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would like to express gratitude and respect to the brave fellow comrades who have insisted on generously giving and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you very much for choosing our products. Before you use our chips, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
After unpacking, please check whether the goods are complete.
If there is anything missing, please contact customer service in time.
The upper cover of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, so do not introduce solvents that may react chemically with the PC.
Do not use a hand-push syringe to directly inject sample into the chip, or liquid leakage may easily occur.
The microfluidic chips of common substrates pass pure water tests under the injection pressure of 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) before delivery.
Chips on glass substrates undergo pure water test under the injection pressure of 800mbar (100um channel) before delivery. When you use chips on glass substrates, please be careful not to collide with sharp objects, otherwise, the substrate will be damaged.
During use, please consider the solution viscosity and do not exceed this range, otherwise fluid leakage may occur.
For the general substrate microfluidic microchip that uses pure water injection in a syringe pump, we recommend that the flow rate should be set below 150ul/min and the flow rate of the oil phase should be set below 50ul/min.
Please increase your flow rate parameters from slow to fast, considering the viscosity of the actual injection liquid.
After the general chip experiment is completed, please clean the internal channel in time, otherwise it will easily cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term usage or improper operation, the chip will not be returned.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand higher pressure or flow rate, you can contact customer service for customization.

Thank you Rabbit for your comment. I originally said that "rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style." I did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your recognition. Your satisfaction will enable us to charge up our batteries and move further forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really awesome. I highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, everything is impeccable.
Makeup artists are very meticulous and will match your makeup according to your style. The cosmetics used are also from first-line brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The entire studio has a very artistic atmosphere, with two little cats playing alongside.
We work in Beijing, and many good movie studios in Beijing have to line up half a year in advance. Some colleagues of ours filmed in Beijing. After seeing the finished movie, I felt it was just so so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor. I feel that this is also a short version for most of people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the wonderful natural moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-design, a great team.
When the film came out, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I had already recommended my girlfriend to go there, and she was also very happy just after seeing the negatives.
I hope that this kind of studio will not be buried and that more people will discover it and shoot with their own style, instead of being the same.
Thank you very much Zhanying and Jingling for their five-star reviews. Both of them are really creative and new people. We are a creative studio. As long as the customers like it, we will do our best to accomplish it fully, thank you for meeting each other.
The sweet and thoughtful assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone on the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot, a very unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting is much better than what I expected. Everyone has worked hard and thank you very much 😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comments. It is a fate to know you. And from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, you have confidence in us as we have a distance of thousands of kilometres. I am very happy to meet you. I have a chance to visit Qinhuangdao next time.

A programming newbie who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for the training. However, if you have no idea in this aspect, it is better to study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you plan to get into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice. Especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have stronger self-control, you can choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, let’s look at the strength of faculty of this institution. If the faculty are not powerful enough, the training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing the training institution, it is best to inquire about the students who come from this institution. After all, only students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact I don't know how to answer that question you asked, because I have not given any specific introduction to your own situation, and learning this matter has a lot to do with your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated from computer science, I personally propose you to self study if you have time, as this is the most efficient and cost-effective alternative. Many offline and online training institutions are actually very good nowadays, but learning costs are high, and the time investment is greater and it basically takes 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is like the situation I have mentioned, it is very convenient to study by yourself. Many learning resources are now free on the Internet. There are also many training resources available at Station B. If you cannot find resources, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources or provide detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can pay a certain amount of learning money and time, then it is suggested to study at a training institution. This way, learning will not be tedious, the teacher will explain in detail, and someone can answer if you have any questions. In addition, it helps in study planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements and offer internal referral quotas. After studies they can recommend you to a company so that you can save a lot of time during the following job interviews.
The above are some of my opinions. Since I do not know your situation, I only briefly introduce it, without going into detail. If you have other things you want to ask, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said to arrive before 1AM and I saw it on the app
what is it
I haven’t finished yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamp installations, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who give me praise silently, I worked hard for my life, life is very tiring but I have to continue.
Life will not disappoint people who work hard. Just follow me if you like and thank all those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, others only look at the results and support the process on their own, facing life, we have to remain strong and do not have any other choice. There is no turning back. We can look back but we cannot go back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we are doing the most dirty work when it comes to cleaning, we will take the most serious attitude to cleaning every corner of the client's house. When we see satisfied smiles and thumbs up from clients, all the hard work will be worth it at that instant, and all the efforts will pay off!
My daily job
─Your request, my service.
Serve carefully, clean attentively, and retain beauty.
For the details that you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping can help you do everything you can to "clean" and serve the loving family.
Ensure the cleanliness of every home, set up household management monuments, deliver in-place services, and make the home pristine.
In-door and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will turn dull if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine. That is the case in life as well.
We can be successful only by endeavouring to do it with attention; we create exquisiteness with detail. We are serious about the beauty of stitching.
Give me a chance, you will definitely be satisfied, the quality says everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
Things are not working well in all industries today!
But I always believe that as long as I act seriously, persistently, and work hard, I will be better than others – at least it will be better than just sitting and complaining!"
The plan for the day starts in the morning, all beautiful things start in the morning. I hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health and good wishes, and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When you are a child, happiness is a thing, and it’s a matter of having it; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, and when you achieve it, you will be happy; when you’re mature, you discover that happiness is a state of mind, and the realization is a matter of happiness.
Be the most true and kindest self, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is one life path, and one's own way; there are two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and living beautifully to old age!
At every stage of life we encounter different difficulties.
Many times, the thing holding you back is not your ability, but rather the courage to face it positively.
Since you can’t avoid it, it’s better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be struck down by difficulties; if you face them, the problem will eventually be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia jointly organize the first Saudi Biennale of contemporary art - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia – the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in Diriyah JAX artistic district, northwest of Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated.
The biennial is jointly curated by the Saud-Dirier Biennale Foundation and China's UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Feiyu, the director of China's UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is “Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones”, which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted in the social and economic transition period and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia’s social and cultural development.
The biennial covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and the exhibition space spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheriting as Experiments, Thinking at the Edge, Going to the Public, Brave New World and On the Spirit of Art.
Among them, the number of works of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total exhibition quantity, covering various types such as paintings, installation art and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attract much attention. Some artists use recycled materials in creative ways, such as Xu Bing's "Back Story Series - Endless Scene of Streams and Mountains" (2014), which used waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
John Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale will establish an international dialogue and provide global audiences with an opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and to strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said: "The aim of the biennale is twofold: to engage Saudi contemporary art in a global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Dec. 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment support for those out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies for promoting rural revitalization and rural public welfare jobs management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to place the poverty-stricken laborers and other poor groups in rural areas for employment. They play an important role in helping poverty-stricken people to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation and effectively upgrade the abilities of public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including the People's Society of Yunnan, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. They mainly standardized the scope, funding management, job development, and job management of grass-roots recruiting rural public welfare position personnel.
In terms of development and setup of posts, the new regulations are made clearly according to the principles of “expecting jobs as needed, assigning staff based on posts, dynamic management, total control”, “who develops, who uses, who is responsible” and “one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management”.
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific duties of main development departments for rural non-profit jobs, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that various rural public welfare post development departments should purchase commercial accident insurance for rural public welfare post resettlement personnel. The relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural non-profit posts.
Wrong address
Hello,
Can I cancel order?
I placed another order
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the rightist has a great era in history, it is not very long, and so short because if you get a little sunshine you will become glorious, and if you drink some boiling water, you will sweat; if they get a little daring, they will gain the utmost advantages and become swayed when they are attacked.
But truthfully speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the perspective of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, as well as promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I care deeply about his comments and have respect for Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes Chinese social issues seriously.
But I disagree with his anti-Communist theories. I believe that the anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, compromising the livelihood of the people, mixed political groups, and foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and people. Those who attempt to gain opportunities through political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk left:
The Left, in reality, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive meaning to the society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right’s words and analyze their thoughts whenever needed, then the Left will not have this good fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently I saw some friends who are shaking against the traitors while refuting the idiocy of leftists. They were very annoyed. I don’t think it’s necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and Zuozhi, they are both mean and unreasonable.
Don’t try to prove that we are right, let alone make the rebels and left psychopaths admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends like this: When the rebels call you the 50 cents and when the leftist calls you the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but as they get old, they forget them or pursue them but then become paranoid.
And the ideal goes further and further away, and even the dragon slayer boy eventually turns into an evil dragon.
Left and right, I think, generally refers to restraint and freedom. The inherited genes of China's history and culture mean that China as a whole should be to the left.
While the domestic right wing is liberal and focused on efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens regulation and pays more attention to fairness and security.
The general expectation in society now is to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, because of the disputes between China and the US, it is certain that it will slant to the left. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't quite understand it, just give it a thumbs up and that's it!
Don't say anything, Huahua is so faithful
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the United States has not only brought Huawei into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to “US-based” companies.
The American imperialists are suppressing China's chip industry and requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises from allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and reduced production capacity by chip manufacturers. This has resulted in the disorder of a global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, “chip shortage” has spread to major industries around the world. For example, automobile companies have stopped production, and mobile phone prices have increased. Almost all industries that use chips have been greatly affected by it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move toward "de-beautification".
To firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States recently took several actions to host the "chip summit"; they also invited the 64 largest country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and funded the support of local American tech giants. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, the old American technology giant Intel spent 20 billion USD to build two wafer processing factories in Arizona, and opened the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel’s move would have a certain impact on TSMC and would likely take away TSMC’s “job”.
The reason for this is because Intel, a veteran tech giant of the USA, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserve. It will certainly be able to rise rapidly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive of Intel’s decision.
At the 2021 Master Think Tank Forum held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark. Regarding Intel's move to build a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel's building of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel's entry into wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still harbors a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been the jewel of the US Empire’s manufacturing industry, held the top position in the world, and was the hegemon in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, production, packaging and testing were all undertaken by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to stand back in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry started to see a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation after the 1980s. In 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s vision became reality and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business towards a single link of “wafer processing” and does not conduct design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was merely a small player in front of the Intel giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou sought an investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only engaged in manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously very self-conscious, looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer processing services at the time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel’s entry into the foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC’s market value has surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with the strong attack from TSMC, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It’s not easy to catch up.
Wait no further
Its been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Let’s take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were selected randomly: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Orion, and the goods pull event. The public opinion spread out to form a peak, and then the index decline (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If the secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump that will appear again.
They appear to be the same as the "Evolution Model of Internet Public Opinion" once displayed on the official website of the CNCA.
What is unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lonely peak], [jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Ground-shaped] means artificial heating, rapidly rushing to the hot search and attracting attention of the public; [Jagged] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic occupy the hot-search list; [cliff-shaped] means a group withdrawal, the hot search has finished its "function", received a new assignment and rushed towards the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of an event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is accurate in every minute. It must have been a unified batch of military forces receiving the task, kicking off a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones attract battles, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which stir up emotion and which are coercive decision making. The black-produced accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking almost all elements of the spread of public opinion into account.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, considering only objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Everywhere we walk, there will be traces left. Let's dig them out together.

First cases of Omicron strain infection were discovered in Mauritius and other countries - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - Comprehensive reports from foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection by a new coronavirus variant Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist arriving in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27. The other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. After coming into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned, his nucleic acid test tested positive on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected patients turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus’ Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three of them were students and came back from a trip abroad earlier this month. Because they all had mild symptoms, they were not admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron virus strains, the Serbia government has continuously enhanced prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and older who enter the country by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in the country.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children from 5 to 11 years old in the country with Pfizer’s new crown vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has detected three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The country’s health authorities conducted genome sequencing of 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three cases of infection.

Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 South Huancheng Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at it. My budget at first was 70,000 to do basic decoration.
Upon arrival at the store, a series of deceptive tricks began.
It was the first time that I went to the store but I just showed them my floor plan. They didn’t inspect the house on the spot and yet, they actually gave me a quotation saying that my 135 house could cost 70,000 yuan. I took a look at the materials and didn’t know what brand they were.
Their second set of tricks is that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money has been paid, you will never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating about whether to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a huge pit. I am a living example of being deceived. When I was in a hurry, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
The quote he gave me had many problems. The price of 70,000 does not include electricity and water renovations, nor includes any doors, cabinets, bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the base installation.
Apart from these, their service points charges are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign a contract without stating anything clearly at first.
When I went to them to get your money refunded, they appeared experienced and had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
In any event, getting bitten is the customer's fault and they are completely not to blame.
There are all kinds of shirking of responsibility, and there are many details. If you do not want to mention them all, you will be in tears. In short, don’t choose them because the houses my friends asked them to renovate are of poor quality, and you will pay various expenses later.
Fool, they are the original deceptive tap decoration, and now they have changed to be Damei, they seem to have closed down and changed into something else.
So please don’t choose such a crap decoration company.
In the future, when you are making choices, you will take a look at these on Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not a small sum.

Starry sky is coming and the Gemini meteor shower will be huge on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12. (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a huge event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not formed by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on popular science in astronomy, said that just like New Year blockbuster films, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year and the "release period" can last from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability and is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the fact that meteors are at a slower velocity, with rich colors and a lot of fireballs, which are suitable both for visual viewing and for beginners to shoot astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year’s Geminid meteor shower will experience its maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (under ideal viewing conditions, the number of meteors can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly above head) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommendation index chart.
“Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was impressive, but this year’s Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, making it less exciting.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the lunar calendar, and the moon's phase is the gibbous moon, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can make observations in the late hours of the night after the moon falls, but pay attention to protecting against the cold and keeping warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to conduct observations in cities. You can choose a location in the suburbs or countryside with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing northeast, and then patiently wait until the moon sets before you can visually observe.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and you don’t need to constantly stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If anyone who loves photography wants to shoot a magnificent ‘meteor shower’, it is best to choose a wide-angle, wide-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, a spare battery and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in the market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TVs themselves are products designed for big screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets users’ needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales volume of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020 and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by laser light source does not enter the eyeball directly. Compared with backlight light of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and the irritation to the eyes is smaller.
Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute, and ophthalmology experts of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, came up with 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparative tests of audience's watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm霾 that laser TV indeed has strong eye protection properties, and even has certain improvement effects in certain areas.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant drop in the price of LCD TVs, most of the laser TVs currently available on the market are priced above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, prices have gradually climbed.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
This definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technological level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV projection distance is shorter than that of traditional projection machines, achieving a 100-inch big-screen experience within a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is compact and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus, the heat generated is lower, losses to devices are small, and the lifespan of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-HD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. When it comes to picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not an option for audio-visual players. If you want to take note of a large screen and an insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its own pros and cons. You can judge on your own after weighing it, but you are afraid to hear one-sided words.
To put it simply, an ultra-wide-angle close-focus projector, a laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the optimal optical design.
In order to block some of the ambient light, it is expensive to use a microstructured Fresnel screen, and the price of the 80-inch LCD can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another thing: I especially hate when the projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point antagonistic to the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that an eye can see is a direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, your eyes will not be able to see it. If you must be more realistic, LCD TV is also diffusely "direct" so even if you turn on the TV, the ceiling will also be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen does not have a diffuse reflection, it cannot form an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of higher gain screens is just ignored and a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe's Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery's Best Quality Store has no branch yet
After adding the appointment date in WeChat, the lady will send me the selected time arrangement so that the reply information is more timely~
Before going there, I watched the shoots in the store, and most of them were outdoor wedding dresses. They were beautifully photographed, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived, I briefly shared my thoughts with my Miss Sister, patiently helped me to try on two styles of clothes that I was struggling with, and finally decided to do my makeup. Before shooting, the photographer will set some props, guide actions, and keep improving on each detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas with me, what I shot was not the style I wanted, but it should be beautiful🙊🙊
After the shots are taken, the photographer will help select photos and communicate post-production style, so I feel very attentive.
The repaired version will take about half a month, wait for the effect~
This is my second time winning the buffet dinner event which is a photo category. Most of outfits in the audience can choose one piece for the photo shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours. Makeup + shooting. The photographer responsible for shooting is a young brother from the post-95 generation. I still feel a little bit young and I hope I can give more advice on the customer’s shooting action guide in the future~ I am very talkative and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Wenshe visual aesthetics photography studio preferred quality store
On the home page, come take a look at Queenie too~
When I arrived at the store, I listed my name and phone number, then chose clothes, such as wedding dresses. After changing three or four suits, I was quite patient. After choosing, I would put on makeup for a long time. The service attitude was good. Later, the photographer would teach you how to pose. However, the pictures were so large that they said the repairs took half a month, and sent them within three to four days, which felt like the same as the original.
【Environment】 The overall situation is good.
Lots of clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup positions and a photo studio inside.
【Service】 Very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you motions very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to take additional shots.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a little off, as the original double eyelid was pasted over with a third eyelid.
The ends of the eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't draw eyebrows everyday.
I have given the photos around ten days ago, but the results of the P image are not very satisfying, it seems the double eyelid stickers are still obviously visible.
Because I am not sure what style I want, I tried two sets and I still chose the black dress. The lady said that this set is more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing my clothes, I started doing makeup and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist were super patient and helped me get the results. I am very pleased with the results.
After I got the makeup and hair done, I began to take photos. The photographer had instructed me to pose throughout the whole process. The process was very relaxing and harmonious.
After finishing filming, I carefully selected four of my favorites as the finishing touches. My brother said that the film will be completed in fifteen and he was very satisfied with its ending~
No reply for 3 days...I can't enroll into the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn't recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can I waive this first, and then charge my monthly fee after your investigation is finished? Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: as prompted in "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", three key words must be satisfied to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders and promoters must have no major violation record in the recent 3 years, a minimum threshold of RMB 50 million can be established, and approval must be obtained from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three rules are actually very harsh. In summary, they have to have strength. They must go through approval by the State-authorized department of China Banking Regulatory Commission (oversees insurance companies and banks across the country) and shareholders have a good style of conduct. As an insurance brokerage company, the policyholder needn’t doubt whether the umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are three thresholds that cannot be met by all insurance companies.
On this point, it is not bad and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurances are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super-Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. Both the claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the payment model perspective: Internet platform products are generally more cost-effective because of the lower cost of operating outlets and staff wages. Moreover, the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing paying pressure on policy holders and at the same time leveraging insurance leverage to the greatest extent possible.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism of the salesman: This is particularly important because insurance is a very professional industry. Many Internet product customers can take out insurance on their own, and there would be many misunderstandings in this case. Regarding health information and occupation, non-insurance professionals tend to add their own subjective awareness when they apply for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or eligible for insurance. This is likely to lead to many hidden dangers in claim settlement and the risk of being denied claims.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing on “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, which also serves as an internet insurance brokerage platform) then I would like to tell everyone in very responsible manner.
Insurances on the Internet are genuine and reliable; the unreliable are people. The Internet channels do not have professional practitioners and there are also many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance policy is 6 million, buy insurance to get a cell phone, and get 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid important issues, and would not tell the insured that 1 yuan in the first month, the next month requires the usual fee, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for a year or two and they are confused about what they bought.
I thought that I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell like a pie).
Free mobile phone delivery is available only in special policy number sections such as 6666 and 8888 at the end of the policy. If the winning text message is sent, it will not be exchanged, and there will be no one to remind you.
(This is another pitfall to the policyholder.) The free critical illness insurance amount of 60,000 is short-term, and if we only rely on this, we don’t have other commercial insurances. In case a serious disease really occurs, what can we do with 60,000, the problem will not be solved, and our future life will start streaking.
At present, the government is also cracking down on misleading online insurance sales.
So looking at things comprehensively, there is no problem with the platform and no problems with the product. What’s problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
I recommend that you give the subject a comprehensive and careful consideration. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, and customers can choose from more opportunities and products. Some of their products are also more cost effective than Internet products.
I have personally helped 59 Internet customers, by underwriting offline products, and saving each person 2000-3000 yuan per year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, who has had 3-year experience in enterprise management training, served nearly a thousand corporate users, has partnered with more than 100 insurance companies. Before buying insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance process, I will shop around for customers to try to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insured, I will organize and keep insurance policies for customers, to make customers feel at ease.
We grow with every customer throughout their life.
I hope my answer is helpful to you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance is the insurance business in which a policyholder can complete all the insurance application process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policy applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign. All steps can be completed independently by the policy applicant.
Although purchasing insurance through internet is not too “ceremonial” and there may not be even printed paper contracts, but this does not in any way affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contracts.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of “telephone sales,” but there is also a fatal problem when purchasing insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When purchasing insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” that we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that will accompany us for a long time and provide us with services for many years to come?
So how can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.

From past to current, I have always been against any form of slander and abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilised society we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such villains.
If we don't pay attention to political parties and factions, the first thing we must resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the time you started posting Facebook friend requests, and then with your ridiculous posts, to your attempts to publish my home location and father's name on social media, I have become unresponsive.
After that, you intensified your actions and not only continued to tag me based on your frequency of six meals a day, but also continued talking about obscure humiliating words about me over Facebook, with your so-called friends, about my appearance, figure, good fertility, any message like putting strawberry in bed, or not. I… forget it.
Somehow I have received several further comments from friends about a photograph of you being uploaded on your Facebook friends account and remarks that contained sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl I can't remain silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was posted, you showed no restraint, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you have. In our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes you can continue with the ridiculous, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments and you can continue to say shallowly that you are just caring and paying attention to me, you can continue to consider it not harassment, you can continue denying it was not your drawing or keep making everything offensive.
Yes, I cannot and have no power to stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and I don't need your judgment about my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for being famous.
A friend asked me: Are you okay?
I said yes, you wouldn’t believe it either.
I don’t think any girl can say she’s okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morals would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice exists in people's hearts.
I cut up a section of the message for you to comment
No one can impersonate you when posting your own post.
All I can say is you are the enemy of civilization.
Smile with understanding
NDO - Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Cheng attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major sessions were held, with discussions centered on the two main themes of digital technology companies and the nation's digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
Nguyen Manh Hung, Minister of Communications and Media, said that despite the continued spread of the new coronavirus epidemic, in 2021, Vietnam’s number and operating income of digital technology companies will maintain a momentum of growth, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam's typical digital products will be deployed in numbers to specifically address the major problems that Vietnam faces. Many digital products have gone abroad and Vietnam's digital technology rankings have improved.
Minister Nguyen Manh Huong called on digital technology companies to take up the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to fulfil the national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various ministries and state organs, companies, entities and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies shared their breakthrough ideas and solutions to mobilize and pool resources from the entire society to develop Vietnam's technology companies, to jointly advance the country's digital transformation, and Zhu Hui’s post-epidemic economic recovery.
In his speech at the forum, Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue and serves all citizens, therefore requires the participation of all people.
People and businesses are the core, subject, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and businesses.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation must reflect the national spirit and require internal force as the primary, strategic, long-term and decisive factor, and external force as the important and breakthrough point.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and facilitate green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases that protect and promote national cultural value, historical traditions, national customs, etc., and promote digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country increasingly prosperous.
Premier Fan Mingzheng asked governments, agencies and companies at all levels to increase leadership and direction during the development of digital technologies, raise awareness about digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve systems for digital transformation, strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology companies in the spirit of respect, communication, listening, and proactiveness.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Cheng attended the 2021 “Made in Vietnam” Outstanding Digital Product Award ceremony and the opening ceremony of the “Made in Vietnam” digital products exhibition.

The home of high speed railway
Address: No.555, North Road, High-speed Railway View map
Here the home appliances are relatively complete, with numerous brands and all the well-known ones.
During Double Twelve, we went to the “Hanston” water purifier store and saw the water purifiers. Activities were going on in the store, and the prices were relatively favorable.
The house has 11 floors in total, from the negative 2nd floor to the 9th floor, and the negative 1 and negative 2 are all parking spaces, and the parking is free during the day!
The surrounding is not so good. There are few hardware stores at the hotel, and the restaurant tastes just average.
This elevator is also speechless. Just like that serious illness, it has to go back and forth from negative two to negative one. It keeps hitting the floor I pressed down and I go down to the first floor from the safety passage. It is also very speechless. It leads directly to a furniture store, which is closed and I cannot get out through the safe passage!
Actually, the home still needs improvement, and there are many areas that have not been developed.
Address: No.555 of High Speed Rail North 1st Road, Shayibhak District. It has convenient transportation and a large parking lot. It is free during the day.
Environment: Honestly speaking, the store is big, with 8 ~ 9 floors, you can buy any furniture, household appliances, small things etc. that you want to buy, as well as lots of famous brands, including Mousse, OPPEIN, Vatican, Boss, Fengchuangzhijia, Hanston, Jacques, AIA, Sealy, Fupinju, Macro, Nature, Zhonglian, Midea, Yadan…, there are really too many brands, I can only remember so many, it is a good place for buying products, if you are tired you can sit on the sofa and rest.
I wanted to buy a set of comfortable sofas recently. My friends said, there are many sofas to choose from there, and I looked at the ones from Gujia Home Furnishings and Meakemeijia, and I think they are okay, but the price is slightly more expensive, so I'm still in a tangle.
Dianping, Urumqi Home Furnishing Store channel will provide you the latest business information such as location of High Speed Railway, telephone number and business hours, etc. If you find decoration companies, you can go to Dianping.com

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) Fuling water green comprehensive service area in Chongqing city was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area formally operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River following the listing of Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water-based green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the vast number of crew members and played an significant role in promoting the high-quality development of shipping on the Yangtze River.

The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China during a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional, pro-CCP media reports from many dimensions: Latest news about China-U.S. relations: the latest satellite images show the three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the United States media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Naval arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to America’s allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson is deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the U.S. aircraft carriers currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean include the "USS Abraham Lincoln" who set off from the United States on January 3.
USS Lincoln also featured for the first time a squadron of F-35C carrier aircraft which was part of the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy currently has the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
Three U.S. military aircraft carriers are gathered around China and make rare visits to Guam with their most powerful weapons. On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing three U.S. military aircraft carriers assembled around China.
(Microblog @South China Sea Strategy Situational Awareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China and make a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier-based transport plane CMV-22B.
(Twitter @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report on January 17 by CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China, and made a rare visit to Guam. Analysis said this was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers pack their most powerful weapons around China and make a rare visit to Guam. China has constructed a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China’s Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called “Boomer submarines.”
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder" submarines in the United States Navy fleet are generally kept strictly secret.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine “the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad,” a system that also includes siloed ballistic missiles on the U.S. mainland as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he is facing “unprecedented competition.” What’s the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue comes mainly from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning, are Meta’s traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest “advertising network”. Many apps add advertisements on Meta and then realize the monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to adjustments in Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to acquire user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to access their own information. Most people's normal response is definitely not to allow it.
And if Google stabs again next time, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta’s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue every year comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta employs several hundred people in the Hong Kong office and has several major agents in mainland China.
When Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it in detail lately, but it's definitely not going to be better than before.
The stage when Chinese firms were burning cash overseas on a massive scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem isn't just declining revenue, but lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly looks at future expectations.
Obviously Meta’s expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse."
The Metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in two or three years.
So the next two years should be difficult times for Meta.
Regardless of the popularity of Facebook, it also generates revenue of $100 billion to $200 billion a year. In fact, Facebook is feeling a serious crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it doesn't have any good security moat.
Although several of his social software have relatively high daily activities and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion is only a blink of an eye.
As for the elusive and unattainable concept of the Metaverse, there is no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the basic reason why Zuckerberg changes the company’s name and keeps looking for the new track. However, I feel that his choice of track is wrong, and it is a road of no return. These are some of my thoughts for reference.
