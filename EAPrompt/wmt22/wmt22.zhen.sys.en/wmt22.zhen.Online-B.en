The research results of students playing the leading role in the annual meeting of Zhejiang University make people's brains open - Xinhua English.news.cn
Washing hands with air, judging diseases with a breath, and accurately searching for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with brain-opening holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life science, and humanities education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value , some of which have been awarded nationally and internationally.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect the health of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: The Doctor's High-Energy Eye
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
The invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless light.
"A lot of diseases are detected early, and the excision is not in place, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, in the early stage of cancer examination, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light discs that adjust the spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under illumination.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Our body weight compresses the air just by standing on the sink of the device.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold award.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skill certificates that I think is important besides the driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, the rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of just standing there motionless and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is so terrifying.
"In China, we have official figures of three million accidental deaths a year, the most dangerous being called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70% to 80% can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing. "
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Response, said.
If a person suffers cardiac arrest, there is no breathing, and there is no heartbeat, you will have no effect by pinching the person.
You must do artificial respiration and chest compressions to save someone.
I found that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can be timely in the face of emergencies react.
It might even save someone's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal to be completed before the age of 25. It was also a few months ago that the first aid certificate was added to the goal list, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take the other certifications I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before. Still very useful!

Let me start with the conclusion. I personally think that "The Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say that this movie has no bright spot, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well selected.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that makes you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, and one that makes you feel indignant after watching it. "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience. It can be used for countless a way to ignite your anger.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel.
Even after watching it, you wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly talk about some of the plots that I have a hard time understanding.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south and depend on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van? ?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the hostess and his brother get the business license?
Why can the little gangsters of the speeding party on the island easily seal a section of the mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a gangster who has no credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't the police call the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the door to sleep for the night?
This inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, and the plot is so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's even worse is the movie's theme, or the movie has no theme at all, just a hideous stitcher.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you thought it might be a drama that wanted to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in the small town. I don't know what I watched, and what followed was a deep doubt about myself, why would I go to the cinema to enjoy the poop when I was a New Year's Eve.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then inspiration + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you can honestly tell the grievances and grievances between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't show things that are contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role in which his new motorcycle was burnt and then he could sing), he couldn't open up some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand watching.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally handicapped but in some ways acts like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is because of her acting skills or the director's request.
There's one more thing I don't understand. As a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival stalls to add congestion to the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment features and advantages:
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells of drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left, and right sides of the modules are concave-convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the shaft wall is much better than that of the flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After combined masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the horizontal holes are connected. After the hole core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
The modules are provided with grooves for inserting bars vertically and horizontally, and the horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars increase the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, water leakage, etc. The well wall module has stable mechanical properties, simple operation, and standard forming dimensions.
The intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-touch LCD display to monitor the entire process of mechanical operation, to achieve ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system .
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic and conveying, and double-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
Concrete inspection well module block making machine equipment distributing box travels and lifts the mold box, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically conveyed, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and tear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, and hydraulic seals to ensure stable and reliable comprehensive performance of the equipment.
The mechanical vibration excitation platform of the wall module of the well wall is made of integral plate steel, and there is no welding point for the line cutting and clamping of the table surface, so that the stuffing box can be freely swayed and guided, and the mechanical wear and tear can be fully reduced.
The mold load is reduced, the packing is combined with two-in-one to encrypt the amplitude, and the integrated, full synchronization, table vibration and mold vibration are adopted to ensure the vibration effect.
The shaft wall module mechanical vibration excitation machine and computer automatically control the amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials, and brake without wear, thereby prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing secondary vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system enrollment is enterprise prospective employees - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive the pilot training will have apprenticeship status at the same time. unit employees.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, the admission and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises should be standardized, and the dual identities of apprentices of secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises should be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises should sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices under the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights and interests protection of the apprentices on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use the form of modern apprenticeship to jointly carry out pre-job training and job-transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, corporate master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is based on the training system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the company is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, each with about 50 pilots, and trained a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve their counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission but mostly mild symptoms
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as physical Flu-like symptoms such as pain and cough.
Dr Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have yet to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
In contrast, in the last wave of Delta, he said, the Covid-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized within days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, observations from doctors and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa: Only 30% of new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks have severe illness, which is half of the severe proportion of the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the recent new crown disease Only 3% of patients died, compared with 20% of cases in the early outbreak in South Africa.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we're only two weeks into this wave. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the world's dominant strain of the new coronavirus, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases in the first week of December, according to health officials, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Review: What to Rely on to Save Abducted Children?
If we compare the famous PSA slogan "No business, no killing", then, in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction", mass prevention and control and anti-trafficking will make abduction unprofitable, risky, and costly. high, such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, an emergency release platform for information on missing children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app is called "Reunion", I felt warm.
The new technology is not only named "literary and artistic" and full of feelings, but also the informatization is properly used, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated many "big words".
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
Prioritize matters, and under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", such as "whether child abduction should be the death penalty" and other controversial and controversial topics, they can be put on hold and discussed with caution; but the rescue of abducted children, etc. Must not.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps to detect the case and retrieve the child.
After all, "fighting kidnapping" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous law enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the children and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, the parents were asleep, only to wake up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, at least a fair amount of protection should be exercised.
Taking turns resting between parents, or keeping children under secure protection, is the least possible way to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on abduction and trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to my country's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still a lot of trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have a backward concept in raising children, and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the authorities to strictly enforce the law.
If the “market” for abductions and abductions exists widely, the traffickers are fascinated by their own interests, constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, and form a situation of “fighting” with law enforcement officers, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of outdated concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from the fresh olive fruit after mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
There are three levels of acidity:
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with light and pleasant botanical aromas and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
There are two grades of refined olive oil:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is an olive oil obtained by the dissolution method extracted from the oil residue and refined.
If you have seen the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like grapes that make wine. Olives from different producing areas and varieties of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best places to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olive oil.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., have similar climates to Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
Picking months for olives:
From March to June each year, the olive tree blooms and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The fruit picking season is from November to February of the following year (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
Democracy summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy" (Summit for Democracy) convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and an authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how daunting the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
The tyrannical regime can never extinguish the small fire of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and drive reforms that enable transparent and accountable governance that is more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to act in the public good. People who were naked in their pursuit of power before.”
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including leveraging all the tools the technological revolution has to offer. "
Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees to remain concerned about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced China's rise without a mechanism in place to hold it accountable," he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is why we must change. "
During the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming the Value of Democracy", Tang Feng, Political Councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released the "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leadership role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective good, and global democracy is showing signs of going backwards.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without shutting down the city, and defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have seriously violated human rights. Surveillance technology assists Chinese companies violating human rights to impose investment restrictions.

Hello, the saliva chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive normal case will be friendlier than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball can't stand it, and it is difficult for the expert to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is—Tennis is so difficult, I know you can’t learn it, and I know you are reluctant to buy expensive ones, and make a cheap one to fool you. If you play twice, you won’t play again. This way This beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. Then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, choose prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets can't sell for the price, new auctions 500, 600 are very good, second-hand 200 yuan, isn't the enjoyment of having a thousand yuan shot not fragrant?
It's very friendly to novices, but once it's past the novice stage, it's tasteless, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery
Could you please help follow up?
put off
thanks
In other words, I already have a credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? So that one didn't matter?

In fact, there is a lot of attention to the dressing and matching of girls who are slightly fat.
The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. The length is almost at the knees, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.
Too long will give the impression of short and fat.
If you wear it into three sections, upper, middle and lower, it will appear that you will naturally increase in height. Even if the upper body, skirt and stockings are used in different colors, it will look like a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for fat girls.
Wearing dark colored clothes, especially short black skirts, can make you look thinner.
If your calves are fat, keep your socks and shoes from being too noticeable.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So that people don't get fat when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fatter, you must tell the tricks of dressing well.
Fat girls should never wear tight short skirts. In addition, the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people look uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (thin The kind of plaid oh), choose a soft printed flared skirt, and match it with a top with a swinging collar, which can well cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
If a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top with the same color as the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat figure.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender. This is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover the big belly, but it can also show your advantages.
A-line short skirts will be very thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. The tops should be tighter to form a layered sense, which will make them thinner.
Simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls can also wear fashion sense.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, the fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the change in dressing and matching, you should exercise more in your life, and strive to get rid of the label of a fat girl one day sooner😄

Girl uses archery target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think it's a flesh wound" - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'archery target' to raise money for her sister" exploded the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than a person. The words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the propaganda person in charge of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such a radical move to raise funds for her sister, but this kind of behavior is not worth advocating. He left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was admonished to raise funds for the "arrow target" on the street
In the picture posted on the Internet, a long-haired girl is standing in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "a". The words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written in black ink on the wooden board, and another wooden board in front of her is written. It has its bank account, WeChat account, Alipay account, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "begging for eyeballs", and many netizens express sympathy for this.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square around 10 am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police from the Tianshui police station near the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were around 20 years old, dressed in youthful beauty.
Among them, the girl who is the "human flesh target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; another girl is shouting for help, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery fees, please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, I couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for laying hands, but they did not participate in it. During the whole process, no one was found to be shooting arrows, but some people watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, the bows and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eyeball fundraising method is not advocated."
After being warned by the police station residents, she has left the police station.

What's hot in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic Projects That Project Managers Can Hit Gold Medal" is very popular. It mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers. , apology is not a problem.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability to manage the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management work gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professionals) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.

In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" in the past. On the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does the PMP test ensure that the project management work is smooth and unobstructed?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they actually carry out project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: Insufficient knowledge of project management, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, but not knowing how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to implement at work, inaccurate project estimates, The control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again and again; the division of labor among members is not clear, the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with the poor communication between departments, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles.

NDO - Gulf Cooperation Council to tackle common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively affecting the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
Resolving differences in Gulf Arab states to restore relations with Qatar stems from a demand for solidarity for the interests of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel for citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with a deal between Iran and the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal the Gulf Arab states have denounced for not being able to solve the missile issue with Iran Agreement to be negotiated.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that failure to address Iran's missile issue and take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran against the backdrop of nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failing to meet the wishes of various Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of the GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to promoting the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District is the loudest!
The car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, and the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits. Four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don’t know, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably when my myvi reaches 30km/h, others will reach 100km/h, um.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all over the body and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too high-profile, everyone is watching it wherever I go, I'm very uncomfortable! (actually kinda cool)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
Practice the posture of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the car cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is so loud that you will be instantly deaf when you get out of the car. (but still cool)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in an ordinary parking space. I am afraid of being knocked when the car next door opens the door!
A bit lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said it himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome to contact us!
For more car information you don't know, it's in The Car Guide / People's Auto Record

A few days ago, a million sports car 911 and 10 million supercar Chiron were knocked down in just a few minutes abroad!
Look at the results, expensive is justified!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a long-term accumulation in the development process of a university, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit is deeply rooted in traditional culture and the changes of the times. Influenced by the advocacy of the value concept of "Ming Virtue, Helping the World, Cultivating Qi and Governing Peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "prospering learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the competition in education, technology and talent is intensifying all over the world. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates my country's confidence and determination to move from a big country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities. .
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, so as to achieve "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer. By continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and realizing the improvement of academic level and school-running quality The second is the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by the Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; the third is the institutional advantage, giving full play to the institutional superiority of the socialist country To enhance the goal-driven, pool consensus and synergy, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in a thousand schools, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running a school: first, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment that integrates science and education, and school-enterprise integration, and form a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second It is to highlight the characteristics of cross-discipline convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-discipline, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and iconic cross-products; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Industry-university-research cooperation system of Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "studying diligently, cultivating morality, discernment, and truthfulness" and the common values of "inheriting rivers and rivers, inspiring truth and virtue, opening up the former people, and building up our country" together constitute the The latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "using the world's talents for me", and reflects the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people in world-renowned schools; The spirit of kindness refers to the cultivation of morality and the tempering of personalities while pursuing the truth; the spirit of reform and innovation embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of knowledge innovation, scientific research innovation, and performance In order to reform and develop, we must reform the old and make a new one; "Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and says that the university should always share the same glory and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
These series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are exactly the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silent, the wise see the invisible".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, and the spirit of the nation can stimulate each other, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

When NFT was out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology. It integrates a variety of gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has delivered a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game , and can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of the company on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First of all, we must choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan; secondly, To choose an industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics are "do the things right," which is to do things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or extend it horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on improving the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core customers and high value. Customer retention rate (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve correct activity goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurate Pull new; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American schools has doubled, but in these three prestigious American schools, the proportion of Asian-Americans has basically remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants" in their so-called "combined" admissions process.
According to Zhao Yukong, a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three colleges and universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentages of Asian-American admissions, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants. more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after finding the facts.
They also hope that the universities under complaint will take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups participating in the complaint, there are also American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency of a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, on the details of the purchase of the factory, and remitted 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Lin signed the "Deposit Receipt for Plant Sale and Purchase" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit will go to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. It is agreed to sign the plant sales contract within a week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the method of payment, which led to the delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Finally, the deposit was paid and the house payment was ready, but the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract in the end, which cannot be attributed to the defendant alone. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract by returning the deposit twice.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Attorney Reminder】 In the process of trading, you must exercise the necessary prudence and care.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary prudence and care, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent the performance of the contract. disputes arise between the two parties.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw lines with ideology. Tooling and weaponizing democracy, pretending to be anti-democracy in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and invited leaders of 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan's leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt both internationally and in the United States. For example, they criticized some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who were invited to attend the meeting. Some people suspected that the real intention of the Biden administration was not for the sake of democracy. The summit was organized for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the video democracy summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is morbid, and problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party confrontation, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, and polarization between the rich and the poor are intensifying." A "rich man's game" built on capital.
US President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks. And those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
Democracy is not something to be taken for granted, he stressed, "We have to renew it in every generation, which in my opinion is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend."
The U.S. pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long campaign that includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
"Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address

The claypot rice is dry and wet, the portion is very generous, the signature tin foil chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the kale is well handled...
Great taste good service warm meat good
The old store in Richang was also an Internet celebrity many years ago. It is a small building in Dongdan with wooden floors.
There is always a long wait at the door to eat the claypot rice, and the casserole of the claypot rice is cracked...
I haven't been to Richang for several years, and the rise of various Cantonese restaurants has scattered the flow of customers.
It is rare to see a seat when you arrive at the store. The quality of the dishes is not to be said, as good as always.

What is Red Label Whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red brand whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and red brand whisky has won the gold medal in the international wine competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're spoiling its aroma.
So how do you drink red label whisky?
Let me give you a brief introduction.
How to Drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is a blend of about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoky aromas in the rich aroma.
The entrance is full-bodied and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be enjoyed straight over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, red-brand whisky and sparkling drinks such as Coke or Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sour taste, can bring visual pleasure to people. Adding drinks can dilute the wine taste and change the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar can also) is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic Hong Fangwei tastes a bit sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon will bring a fresh fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red brand whisky. You can try it as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational thinking: How to make "student tyrants" and "student scumbags" get their own way in college exams - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the type of exam questions to make the exam truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On a university campus, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, combined with different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may pass the exam by focusing on the attack before the test. If they think of other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, there is a "strange situation" that "student scumbags" can pass the test without any investment, and even get high marks; .
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the university examinations are not without reason, and I believe this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote directly.
In fact, anyone who has gone to college knows that it is not uncommon to prepare for the test unexpectedly, to "take" test questions from teachers in various ways, to try to delineate the scope of the test, and to obtain "key tutoring" before the test, even in the test. It is not uncommon to have cheat sheets and begged teachers to raise their hands after exams.
In the author's opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation guide, measuring the passing of a university examination depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether or not to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically subject-based theories and basic common sense. From a knowledge point of view, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, test groups are generally formed into question groups, and then senior teachers of the subject co-ordinate the test papers to form the test papers. The examination papers are also participated by all the teachers responsible for the subject, so that the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of test questions that conform to the actual teaching and learning situation. The difficulty of the questions is normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so as to make the test propositions difficult, easy, and difficult. The question type has a dynamic grasp, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question type.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans. If things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letter of recommendation from students, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course end-of-course examinations, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of test paper propositions and review links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen curriculum teaching. Comprehensive examination.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single type of test questions and repeated questions is an issue that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the effort is expensive in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content thoroughly, It is even more necessary to thoroughly understand the students' learning situation, and to understand both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and examinations will be more realistic, so that "students" and "students" have their own place.
If I can't change the branch location for me, can I have delivery instead?
So I don't have to give me more money, right?

Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street) has no branch yet
Before taking the photo, because our time was not arranged, the time was changed twice. Consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose to shoot on a weekend with good weather.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, were amazing.
It was the first time in my life that I was officially wearing makeup, and wow~ I can't believe I'll be so good looking one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient in makeup, and their makeup is natural.
The location was shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was fine that day, so I didn’t feel cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn’t want to let customers delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, we didn’t want to add photos at all, just 24 photos in the package, one Zhang did not add it (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000. I was stunned at the time, and I was afraid that I would choose too many)
The photos were repaired today, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them and thought they were not very good. They immediately repaired them for me.
I turned out the photos my sister took before and compared them. I think I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take a wedding photo with Mrs. Xuan Han Jin!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wish you a happy and prosperous future!

Negative nucleic acid within 48 hours, setting up a "buffer zone", the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a document requesting to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring them to leave the land border port cities (connected with Hong Kong and Macau) in the near future. Persons who travel to land border ports and cities must have at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when each province, region and city determines the port city scope and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing a differentiated management policy by region, changing from one line of defense against spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move the border forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillovers, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimal social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clustered epidemics in my country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice points out that this has revealed that some local epidemic monitoring and early warning are not timely, closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions is not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing is a mere formality, cold chain items are not properly sterilized, the management of centralized isolation places is not standardized, and epidemic emergency response. Deal with problems such as insufficient scientific precision.
The notice requires that efforts should be made in 9 aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of weak points in the prevention and control of port cities, and to do a good job of prevention and control without slackening, scientific and precise , Weave and fasten the external anti-input line of defense.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to the people's complaints. Outstanding issue.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and flags) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (regions, states, leagues) where they are located, and the municipalities where they are located. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality). According to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, it will be determined and announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video shows the truth about 20 years of U.S. bloodthirsty killings - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US launching the Afghan war in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years of military violence, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Abusing drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and setting up killing teams.
For 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up "black prisons" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have fueled more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorism".
The war did not bring hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Accidentally read the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, why this customer asked a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of bonded logistics companies, here is the following This text might explain why the client wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then you must ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is the better.
There are also consumers who reacted after eating with this mentality and said that the taste or taste of the cans is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why the listening device is expensive, where is it expensive?
Why do they have the same raw materials and the price difference is so big?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising fees every year. Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion cost of the market, for example: the promotion staff of the shopping mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are canned, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked with the doctors in the hospital, and they will assist in the promotion of the products, and they will take a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such a method of operation. In fact, this practice is deceiving consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in the cans on the premise of having cans at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans is the same as that of bags after opening, it's just that the bags are not easy to store after opening, and are prone to moisture deterioration.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, assuming or implying that you can "do" and then telling you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" has been skipped all at once.
Because of this, these books have a common feature - either do your best in one go, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; either you will climb Mount Tai, or you will simply stay where you are. wait.
This kind of "best principle" will admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For someone who sticks to the rules, conforms to the old rules, and refuses to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly deceiving yourself and playing the piano to the bull.
The vast majority of people will show their timidity in front of the word "transformation", hold back and make up their minds; It's not long, and it won't last for a while, and it's hard to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting from Tomorrow" is a classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, and makes most people "sigh and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a path that has the potential to put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a "small wins for big wins" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0 ; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success that follows the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" on the surface is under the banner of making everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire only a small number of people; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate as many people as possible. to benefit more people.

Resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, which is the same as the previous year. Compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002, the cumulative increase was more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to a large number of human hunts and the deteriorating environment of naked carp breeding waters. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially propagated and released, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers source area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in my country and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year. "Complete arrest management system.

I just saw an article about menstruation, it's too long.
For men who don't know about it.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13-15 and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
Afterwards, on the premise of good health, it will be more regular once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be able to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance.
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; Change, no pain in the past does not mean no pain for a lifetime.
The menstrual period is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours within a few days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing I can do is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck the blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately when the menstrual period begins before there is time for dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take it after the dysmenorrhea begins.
Due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release before the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about to the cycle, inexplicable diarrhea, basically menstruation will come within two days.
It is best to replace the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the pre-prepared portion, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Modify it here, tampons don’t need to be changed often, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal disturbance during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It wasn't just blood that was flowing, it contained the shed lining of the uterus.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, they are all removed (menstrual discharge). Months to build a new house, again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, bleeding 24 hours a day, a few days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants to?
But people can be born because their mothers have menstrual periods. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mothers for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society brainwashed women into being dirty and shameful. Everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation of the female body for life is disgusting, it should not be said in public, girls stand up, stop thinking this way, never experienced it, and will not in this life Men who have experienced and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and don’t know what to do. How can you be so embarrassed to face your mother and want your own children with this attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it's really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival, it is disappointing to send the wrong one
Have to order additional meals for the children
I hope the store is busy to check the products
Is the foot bath numbness due to leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a very good role in foot care. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bath tubs are more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. Lots of options.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health appliances such as foot bath tubs are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot bath tubs, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but when his father soaked his feet, the soles of his feet felt numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath tub, but he did not expect to turn off the vibration function, and his father still felt numbness on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen actually turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he returned the foot tub, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that this long-established footbath does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of the maximum temperature setting, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what kind of materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath tub will not have the problem of electrification, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath when purchasing.
Separation of water and electricity, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take a pencil test at will.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo
Hunan Daily, December 10th (all media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan correspondent Liu Xiaoling photographed Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, Innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and speed up the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand presentation at the opening ceremony: the source of Huhong is Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "Colorful Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunans, four waters and five colors of tea".
The tea industry in the province has intensified innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, dark tea, and black tea have taken turns to make efforts.
Feng shui turns, and black tea works again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea gardens has skyrocketed.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua liked to hold the "source of lake red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "Bing Lichun" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market more or less, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
With a touch of red, Xinhua black tea is infused with the connotation of tea culture.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up because there was no parking below.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the fundamental laws of philosophy that seek to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "the metaphysical is called the Tao, and the metaphysical is called the instrument" in "Book of Changes • Xie Shang", which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities, and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of research that does not say a word about God.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
Mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judgment of various moral views, and give moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior.
It studies what kind of moral code people should abide by), applied ethics (the science of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live their lives) , summarizing from the observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral some ethics).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part: the ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representative: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, continental rationalism ethics, representative Figures: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative: Voltaire et al., 18-19th century, German academic ethics, representative: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18th-19th century , British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sikkivik, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, Representative figures: Li Kaier, etc., in the late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).

I just don't want to go downstairs to buy something, that's why I spend so much money on takeout
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you for your humanitarian assistance over the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, especially since I issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my personal name in early 1994, which has not been interrupted so far. Rescue.
Now, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started working as families.
It was your act of righteousness that helped us as families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have also retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating to our bereaved family, the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian aid activity should have come to an end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the All-American Federation of Independent States and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.

Relief funds often fail to reach the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphaned Elderly Specially Poor Household Relief Fund", which has been implemented until now. .
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations during the June 4th Movement, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the family members of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of the June 4th Movement that year.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently carried out their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June 4th donation for the sake of the donors. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our thanks to Mr. Ding for his letter "To a friend".
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families to terminate the program within two years and resume immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have been generous and risky to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you very much for choosing our products. Before you use our chips, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
Please check whether the goods are complete after unpacking.
If there is any missing, please contact customer service in time.
The upper cover of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material. Do not pass solvents that chemically react with PC.
Do not use a hand-push syringe to directly inject samples into the chip, otherwise liquid leakage may occur.
The microfluidic chips of common substrates pass the pure water test under the injection pressure of 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) before delivery.
Chips with glass substrates pass the pure water test under 800mbar (100um channel) injection pressure before delivery. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects when using glass substrate chips, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause liquid leakage.
For microfluidic microchips with ordinary substrates, under the condition that the syringe pump uses pure water to inject samples, we recommend that the flow rate be set below 150ul/min, and the oil phase flow rate is recommended to be set below 50ul/min.
Please increase your flow parameter value from slow to fast according to the viscosity of the actual injection liquid.
After the experiment of the general chip is completed, please clean the internal channel in time, otherwise it will easily cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be returned.

Thank you Rabbit for the comment. I originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks for the recognition of Dandan, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity and move forward, we will continue to work hard!
This photo studio is really great and I highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and will match your makeup according to your style, and the cosmetics are also big brands.
Not to mention Mr. Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We are working in Beijing, and the best photo studios in Beijing need to line up half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues filmed in Beijing. After watching the finished film, I felt just so so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also a short version of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, an excellent team.
When it came out, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have already recommended my best friend to go there, and my best friend is also full of joy just after seeing the negative.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover it and shoot it in their own style, not the same.
I am very grateful to Zhanying and Jingling for their five-star reviews. Both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting each other.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting, an unforgettable experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I imagined. Everyone has worked hard, very Thank you all 😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comments. Knowing you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust in us is so many thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. I have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I get the money?

Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don’t have this idea, it’s better to study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the faculty of this institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will all be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from a computer science major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good. , but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more, and it basically takes 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources at station B. If you can't find resources, you can also contact through the profile. Come to me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of money and time for study, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that the study will not be very strenuous, the teacher will explain in detail, and there will be someone to answer any questions. In addition, in the study planning Or supervision can also help.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, and there are internal referral quotas. After learning, you can recommend to the company, so that you can save a lot of trouble in the interview process of looking for a job later.
The above are some of my opinions. Because I don’t know your situation, I only give a general introduction and are not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.

To do it with heart can be successful, to create exquisiteness with meticulousness, we are serious about beautiful sewing.
Give me a chance, and you will be satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is trustworthy, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
All walks of life are not good at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent, and work hard, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!"
The plan of the day is in the morning, all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good luck, and keep a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and it was happiness to have it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and it was happiness when it was achieved; when I matured, I found that happiness was a state of mind, and it was happiness when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest version of yourself, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one way in life, and you have to walk your own way; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and living beautifully until old age!
At every stage of life, there are different challenges.
In many cases, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face them, the problem will be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators jointly hold the first Saudi Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was held on the 11th in Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Officially open to the public, a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is co-curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Feiyu, curator of China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones" "Inheritance as an Experiment" "Thinking at the Edge" "Going to the Public" "Beauty" New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation art and performance art. He uses recycled materials to create works. For example, Xu Bing used waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in "The Story Behind the Series: Endless Map of Streams and Mountains" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this year's Biennale will establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is twofold, not only to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance for the people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used for the placement of poverty-stricken laborers and other rural groups in difficulty. It plays an important role in various public service capabilities.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly unified and standardized the scope of objects, fund management, job development, and job management for grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare personnel.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations are clear, in accordance with "set up posts on demand, assign personnel by post, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person for one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management" " principle to set.
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarified the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulated that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase commercial accident insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel. ; Require relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

2. Although the rightists have had a successful era in history, they have not been long, so they are short because a little sunshine will make them bright, and a little boiled water will make you sweat; if you have a little success, you will be able to look forward to Shu, and if you are attacked, you will be attached to the generals.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about what he said and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems. seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries to take advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, we must have a patient and responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who try to take chestnuts from the fire by political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk left.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right's speech and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the Left will not have such a good fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends who were arguing against the thieves and refuted the left epilepsy, and they were really angry. I don't think it is necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and the left epilepsy, they are all one-strand, unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the thieves and the left madmen admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends like this: When the rebels call you fifty cents, and when the left man calls you the right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal is getting farther and farther, and even the dragon slayer eventually becomes a dragon.
I think that left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes of history and culture have led to the fact that China as a whole should be left-biased.
While the domestic right wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, in the dispute between China and the United States, it is certain that it will turn to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just like it and it's over.
Don't say anything, Huahua is so loyal
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" companies.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies from allied countries to block my country's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers. , resulting in the chaos of the global chip supply chain shortage.
Today, the "lack of chips" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", more and more technology giants in countries have begun to "de-beautify".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old and the United States have recently made frequent moves, hosting the "chip summit", and inviting giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and funding to support the local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, the old-fashioned technology giant in the United States, spent US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement. Regarding Intel's move to build a fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still holds a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US imperialist manufacturing industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were all completed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to divide labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design. in wafer fabrication plants.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously a bit self-righteous and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in the past have now started to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into foundry was ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.

Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Orion, the event of goods pulling, the spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again. .
They look the same as the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [Lone Peak Shape], [Jagged Shape], and [Cliff Shape].
[Lone Peak Shape] means artificial heating, quickly rushing to the hot search list, attracting public attention; [Sawtooth shape] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [Cliff shape] means collective withdrawal, and the hot search is finished function", received new tasks and rushed to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that a unified batch of naval forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones lead the battle, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones incite emotions, and which ones coerce decision-making , Black production accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries find first case of Omicron strain infection - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; After contact with a person who returned from South Africa, the nucleic acid test was positive on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed the first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
These three people are all students. They returned from overseas trips earlier this month. Because they all had mild symptoms, they were not admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron virus strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air must undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in Cyprus.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating Pfizer’s new crown vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that for the first time in the country, three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were found.
The country's health authorities sequenced the genomes of 12 COVID-19-positive samples collected from Nov. 9 to Dec. 2, and found the three infections.

Damei 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 South Huancheng Road
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at it. At first, my budget was 70,000 to be a basic decoration.
Came to the store and started a series of tricks.
It was the first time I went to the store and I just showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the house to measure the house. They could actually give me a quote saying that my house of 135 can be dealt with at 70,000 yuan. I looked at their material and didn't know what brand of material they were.
Their second trick is that as long as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you will never be able to get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
There are many problems with the quote he gave me. 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovations, and does not include any doors and cabinet bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the basic installation.
In addition to these, their point-of-service charges are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign a contract without making it clear at the beginning.
When I went to them to get my money back they appeared to be very experienced and have a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
It's the customer's problem that they'll be bitten to death anyway, and they're not to blame at all.
There are all kinds of shirk responsibility, and there are many details. If you don’t want to talk about them, you will be in tears. In short, don’t choose them, because the quality of the house that my friend asked them to renovate is also not good, so I will give you various expenses later.
Damn, they are the original deceptive faucet decorations, and now they are changed to Damei, it seems that they have closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a foolish decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, please look at these on Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of merchant reviews. For details, please refer to the merchant acceptance statement
The public comment Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest business information such as Damei 360 integrated home improvement address, telephone number, business hours, etc., find a decoration company decoration company, and go to the public comment
So scary, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, you will be held accountable.
I asked if I could cancel in less than 15 minutes

Starry sky has an appointment 丨 Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great deal on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers Observations can be made in the second half of the day.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy popularization, said that just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. Together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of meteoroids, rich colors, and a lot of fireballs, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum time of ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, when the radiant is directly overhead, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour) is 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Beautiful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, which will be a little less exciting.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. The moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the second half of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to keeping warm and cold. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing the northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then you can observe it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower is very large in all directions, so there is no need to stare at the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower all the time.
If you like photography, if you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products for large-screen TVs.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the ophthalmologist of Peking Union Medical College Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms that: laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when more and more attention is paid to vision health, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous drop in the price of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs on the market are mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
Definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing You can judge for yourself, but you are afraid to listen to one side's words.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a micro-structured Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes can’t see it. So, if you have to be more realistic, LCD TVs are also diffusely "direct". Isn't the ceiling of the TV also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it cannot be imaged at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is just ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery has no branches yet
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the lady will send me the optional schedule, and the reply information is more timely~
Before I went, I saw the shooting works in the store, more of which were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved a lot of shooting styles.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with the young lady, and patiently helped me to try two sets of style clothes that I was struggling with, and finally decided to start the makeup and styling~ The photographer will set up some props before shooting, will guide the action, and be aware of every detail. Also more refined.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, the style I shot was not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shooting, the photographer will help to choose the photos and exchange the post-production style. I feel very careful.
The repaired film will take about half a month, wait for the effect~
The second time I won the photo-type Overlord Dinner~ Most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for the shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s, I still feel a little green, I hope to give customers more advice in the future on the guidance of shooting actions~ Very talkative Yes, the shooting process was more enjoyable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery preferred quality store reply
On the home page, let's take a look at Queenie~
When I arrived at the store, I filled in my name and phone number and then selected clothes. I could choose from wedding dresses. I was quite patient after changing three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, I put on makeup for a long time. The service attitude is also good. When it came out, it felt like a big face. Intensive repair said it would take half a month, and it was sent in three or four days. It felt like it was no different from the original film.
【Environment】The whole thing is good.
Lots of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and there is a studio inside.
[Service] Very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make a reshoot.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit too much, the original double eyelid was pasted with the third eyelid.
The ends of the eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who do not thrush their eyebrows every day.
The photos have been given for more than ten days, but the effect of the P picture is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I don't know what style I want, I tried two sets, and I chose the black dress. The lady said that this set is more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hair stylist and makeup artist were super patient and helped me get it done. I am very satisfied with the results.
After I got my makeup and hair done, I started taking pictures. The photographer guided me throughout the whole process. The process of posing was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming, I carefully selected four of my favorites as Jingxiu, and said that the ending of the film within 15 years is very satisfying~
No reply for 3 days...I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn't recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
I now have to pay the shipping every time
Can I waive it first, and then charge my monthly fee after your investigation is complete. Is that ok?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, promoters, no major illegal records in the past 3 years, minimum limit It can be established only for RMB 50 million and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three items are actually very harsh. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength. It must be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good style. As an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance , the insured does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, not bad, is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform. For example, the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both Hetai Life Insurance, Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, and there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of sales staff’s wages, and the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payment, and reducing the payment pressure of policyholders. , and at the same time, the lever of the insurance can be leveraged to the maximum extent.
This is still very good.
Can consider it.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the salesperson: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements. Many Internet product customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, Non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or fit, which is prone to many hidden dangers in claim settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telesales on “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insured 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, and receive 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important ones. The fee ranges from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct the fee for a year or two and they are not sure what they bought.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent to the special policy number segment of the policy tail number such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be redeemed by itself, and no one will remind it.
(This is another pit for the insured.) The free coverage of 60,000 critical illness insurance is short-term. If you only rely on this, there are no other commercial insurances. In case of serious illness, what can 60,000 do? No problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, and each person has saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in insurance premiums.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in corporate management training, has served nearly 1,000 corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance process, we shop around for our customers and try our best to get the best underwriting results for our customers. After we apply for insurance, we will arrange the policies for the customers and take care of the policies, so that the customers can rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured.
Although the online insurance does not have a "ceremonial sense", it may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line of "telephone sales", but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an agent that can accompany us for a long time and in many years' time? What about the "insurance intermediaries" who also serve us?

From the past to now, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests and then making sarcastic posts to the time you tried to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends. Leave a message about growing strawberries on the bed, whether to insert it or not, I... forget it.
How could I know that later I received a number of friends from friends about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friend account and remarks that were sexually harassing.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't be silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue to say that this is sarcastic, obscure, humiliating, abusive, you can continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your fault or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would want to be so humiliated in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut off part of the message for your review
No one can impersonate you in your own posts.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization

Three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, satellites discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the U.S. aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean include the "USS Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the above-mentioned two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy currently deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo@South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) The three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam, analysts said, sending a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on a rare visit. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and Continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually closely guarded.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," a system that also includes siloed ballistic missiles located in the continental United States, as well as nuclear-capable warheads such as the B-2 and B-52 bomber.
Chatting with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, and the market value has evaporated by 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded that "faced with unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps have external Meta advertisements, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about several hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the first two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it specifically lately, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning cash overseas on a massive scale is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem isn't just declining revenue, it's the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current popularity. It also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software now have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has no confidence, and the subversion is the blink of an eye.
As for the elusive concept of the metaverse, there is absolutely no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for it. The root cause of the new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
