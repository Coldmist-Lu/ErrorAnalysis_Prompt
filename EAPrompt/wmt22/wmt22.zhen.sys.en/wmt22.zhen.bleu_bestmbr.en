Undergraduate students at Zhejiang University annual meeting, research results are inspiring - Xinhua English.news.cn
Wash hands with air, judge diseases with breath, accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-filled academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, whose research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health status from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The early detection and excision of many diseases are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer examination, if doctors cannot see all tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light discs to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented an "air hand washing device".
Just stand on the device's sink, and our body weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands!"
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides a driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, the rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, or a respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls down, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there dumbfounded and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is so frightening.
"In China, we have official data that 3 million people die accidentally every year, the most dangerous one is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70 to 80 percent can be saved, and less than 1 percent in Shanghai and Beijing.”
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Response, said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, there is no breathing, no heartbeat, you have no effect on pinching the person.
You must do artificial respiration and chest compressions to save the person.
I find that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid, but it is too late when something happens, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
It might even save a life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals to be completed before the age of 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals was a few months ago, but it is indeed completed!
Now I'm going to take another test for other certificates. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw in Xiaohongshu before I have a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I have to have a first aid certificate to take the test, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!

Let me start with the conclusion, I personally think that "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say whether the film has no bright spot, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well selected.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that Making you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, and one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching it. "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel. It is indescribable, and there are many loopholes like the windbreaker on Ma's body.
Even after watching it, you wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, it is a piece of shit.
First let me briefly talk about some of the plots that I have a hard time understanding.
The male lead should live on a small island in the south, and he lives with his grandma.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to watch the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the hostess and his brother get the business license?
Why can the little gangsters from the party on the island easily seal a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road parked on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop is too obvious.
Why did a gangster with bad credit and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't the police call the police, the police in the movie asked whether there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sits outside the room door to sleep for the night?
These sort of inexplicable plot points exist throughout the film, and are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all, just this monstrous stitcher.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, and after a little more than 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway throughLarge-Martin, you think it might be a drama that demonstrates the difficulty of survival in a small town. After watching it, you don't have any idea what you are watching, but what follows is a deep suspicion of yourself, why go to the cinema to enjoy the dirty stool after watching it during a new year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspiration + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie goes to success step by step.
If you want to make a romance, then you should honestly talk about the grudges between the young man in the small town who likes to ride motorcycles and the girl who waits.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot have anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character Yin Zheng played in that his new motorcycle was burned, and then he could sing), he couldn't read some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't stand.
As for the heroine who is clearly not mentally retarded, but acts like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects, I really don't know if this is due to acting skills or the director's request.
Another thing that I can't understand, as a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival stalls to add to the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well block machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, and well wall module machinery in China, from semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it now has excellent quality, mainly produces hydraulic, mobile and fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment features and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, storm drains, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are all concave-convex groove structure, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the shaft wall is much better than that of the flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combined masonry is connected, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the horizontal holes are connected. After the hole core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproof.
The modules are provided with grooves for inserting reinforcements vertically and horizontally, and the horizontal and longitudinal reinforcement should improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, water leakage, etc., and the well wall module has stable mechanical performance, simple operation and standard forming size.
The intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module block machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-touch touch-type LCD display, and monitors the entire process of mechanical operation to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic and conveying, and double-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
Concrete inspection well module block machine equipment distributing box goes up to release the mold box, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically transported, all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thus reducing the mechanical wear and tear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well modular block machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, and hydraulic seals to ensure that the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration excitation platform of the well wall module adopts the integral plate steel, and the table has no welding point for line cutting and clamping, so that the stuffing box can be swing and guided freely and fully reduce the mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the filling is combined into one to encrypt the amplitude, and the integrated, full synchronization, table vibration and mold vibration are adopted to ensure the vibration effect.
The shaft wall module mechanical vibration excitation mechanism and computer automatically control the amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance of raw materials, and there is no wear and breakage, thus extending the service life and reducing costs.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing secondary vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system, admission is industry prospective employees - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who received training will have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as team employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and admissions procedures of vocational schools and the employment procedures of enterprises should be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices are also identified as secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of the enterprise. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, the apprentice, the school and the enterprise sign a tripartite agreement, and the apprentice, guardian, schools and enterprises must sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of each party, the specific positions, teaching content and rights protection of apprentices in these situations.
Encourage pilot schools to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for employees in the form of modern apprenticeships and cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, corporate master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the post-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 pilots of municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship in three batches, each with about 50 students and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
According to the principle of piloting and then implementing itotically, from point to face, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve the skills of students to position, and improve their counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission, but mostly mild symptoms
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Ormicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs, and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have required hospitalization.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more at risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
In contrast, in the last wave of Delta, he said, the patients he treated with Covid-19 had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, doctor observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa:of the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% were severely ill, which is half of the severe disease ratio in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent patients died, and in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain of coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Thanks to the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Review: What to rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare it to the famous public service advertisement slogan "No buying, no killing," then in a favorable environment where there is no demand of "abducting abduction", mass prevention and control and all people fighting against abduction make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and cost high, and such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to retrieve abducted children in time.
I heard that the app is called "Reunion", I felt warm.
The new technology means is not only named "literary" and full of feelings, but also can be used properly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of trafficking and law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
However, before the abduction case is solved, the personal safety of the victim should be given priority.
The priority of the matter, under the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether abducted children should be sentenced to death" and other widely controversial裱 can be put on hold, and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed by one more minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that can directly help to detect cases and retrieve the child.
After all, "fighting abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to judicial protection, and meticulous law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "nursing and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at the train station, the parents are sound-sleeping, only to wake up to find that the child is missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a fair amount of protection.
Taking turns resting between parents, or keeping children under secure protection, is the least of the tactics to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police’s crackdown on abduction and trafficking, the party purchasing abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for child abduction is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may be the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The penalization point is high and the maximum punishment is severe. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the official and strict law enforcement.
If the "market" for abduction exists widely, and the traffickers are full of greed, constantly innovating methods of abduction and forming a "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the addiction campaign will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking out of backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress in Malan Mountain
Draw forge ahead strength from the party's century-old struggle history
Hunan Daily reported on December 10 (all media reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, gave an interactive presentation in the Malanshan Video Cultural and Creative Park to deeply study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, learn and implement the spirit of the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches to Hunan, and studying and implementing the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong explained the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session in a comprehensive and systematic manner from three aspects: ideals and beliefs, original mission, self-revolution and the great youth party, party leaders and party theory. He combined his own insights and personal experiences.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
There are three levels according to the acidity:
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade, highest quality olive oil and a pure natural product.
Great taste, with light and pleasant botanical aromas and no more than 1% acidity.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): is an olive oil obtained by the dissolution method extracted from the oil residue and refined.
If you have seen the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You must know that olives are just like grapes that make wine. Olives from different producing areas and different varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best places to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olive oil.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates are also Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. in the southern latitudes.
Picking months for olives:
Each year from March to June, olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of the oils found so far.
The Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy", convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and an authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
The Taiwan government representative and political councillor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how difficult the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
A tyrannical regime can never extinguish the little fire of liberty that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and push for reforms that enable transparent and accountable governance, more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to run naked in pursuit of power before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including using all the tools the technological revolution has to offer.”
Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees of their ongoing concern over the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced the rise of China without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We have to use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.”
During a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Primitive Democratism and affirming democratic values", Tang Feng, a political committee member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a "State Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As democracy in Taiwan is in the ascendant, we always stand firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and take a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of going backwards as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective good.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves.”
During the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were藜estly violated human rights. It also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I cannot stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice.
Not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive ligand will be more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of "starter" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, hard balls can’t withstand, and it is difficult for athletes to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is- tennis is so difficult, we know that you can't learn it, and you know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones to fool you. If you play twice, you will not play again, so this racquet is cheap and you will not feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so the good rackets can’t sell for the price. New ones will be good at 500, 600. Second-hand ones will be 200, and will it be good to own a thousand yuan racket?
Very friendly to novices, but it's tasteless once past the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.

In fact, there are a lot of attention to the clothes for girls with fat body.

For girls who are slightly fatter, you must tell the tricks of dressing well.
Fat girls must not wear tight short skirts, and tops should not be too short or tucked into skirts, it will make people look very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind that are thin plaid). Choose a soft printed flared skirt with a top with a swaying collar, which can well cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
fat girls wear short skirts, they should choose a top with the same color as the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat figure.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer. This is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a MM with fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.

Girl as archery target to raise money for her sister: "I think it's better if it hurts the body" - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "target human flesh, ten yuan per arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passersby can use bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl made such an excessive behavior by raising donations for her sister, but this behavior is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the street " target " woes
In the pictures circulated on the Internet, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board in the shape of a " full ", the words "Human target, ten yuan an arrow" written in black ink on the wooden board. Another wooden board in front of her has her bank account number, WeChat account and Alipay account number written on it.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move was "begging for eyeballs", and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square at around 10 am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a lot of onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police from the Tianshui police station near the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, all about 20 years old, dressed in youthful beauty.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; another girl was shouting at the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery, please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, when he could not think of a good way to raise funds, this act was done.
He said that in the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was in charge of laying hands, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone onlookers took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After the police identified by the public security department, the bow and arrow used were not under the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "this kind of eyeball fundraising method is not recommended."
After being warned by the police station residents, she has left the police station.

What's hot in 2021?
Definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was a very popular article "Look! Olympic Projects that Project Managers Can Hit With Gold Medals". It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead on many projects, and no one can do it. Moving bricks, traveling, and staying up late are the day-to-day activities of project managers, and even don't speak of聆sting, carrying the blame, and making apology.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also reveals the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the inability to manage the current project management.
Those who are engaged in project management work gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma in their work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "China's Project Management Development Report in the Twenty Years (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the country has accumulated nearly 600,000 candidates for PMP®, about 420,000 people passed PMP® certification, and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificate holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, which means that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" in the past. The ever-changing work environment has taught us that we have to learn to explore the way forward while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does the PMP test ensure smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really implement project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, making no project management theory and not knowing how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and institutional support, inability to implement at work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and procrastination on projects; unclear division of labor among members, and the dead-sticks in the team don't know how to deal cross-departmental assistance and communication is not smooth, so the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, has helped many outstanding companies to train a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers and has obtained the honorary title of "China-based Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" with the online course "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
Online Course of R&D Project Manager Special Training Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower cost and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
Words have no evidence, you can first look at what other students have to say about this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the former Huawei R&D and management team), but also combined with international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known companies.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms to help students convert and apply the learning content to specific work after class.

Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" Carnival national online payment business transaction volume reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
The variety reduced red packets and the eye-catching live broadcast once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger, but on the other hand, they also have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and on contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents perform better in financial consumption, but they are different in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will remain the focus of financial education. As found in the "Report on the Debt of Young Chinese People" issued by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation overall presents a rational consumption trend.

NDO - Gulf Cooperation Council to tackle common challenges
stops for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
Amid the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties to Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively affecting the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states bridging their differences to restore relations with Qatar stem from a demand for unity for the interests of the countries and regional stability, aimed at meeting common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as impossible resolve their missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Various Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed.
In the background that nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failed to meet the wishes of various Gulf states, Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of the GCC countries since the dispute between some members with Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, presenting measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is known as the loudest exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District!
This car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget about it, I don't know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which means that your myvi will reach 100km/h when it reaches 30km/h, um.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching it wherever you go, so I’m very uncomfortable! (Actually, it’s a bit cool)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a little awkward (because you will not climb out of the car and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and immediately deaf after you get out of the car. (But still very cool)
The body is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in the ordinary parking space. I am afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when the door is opened!
A little lonely, because there are no rivals on the road (what the editor said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, please contact us!
For more car information you don't know, in The Car Guide / People's Auto Record
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe all car owners will know, Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also millions!
That day, foreign countries crashed millions of sports car 911 and 10 million supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it is justified!
Let the spirit of university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by long-term accumulation of a university in the development process, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, rising in the autumn of national crisis, the spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of times. It advocates the value concept of "bright morality and socialism, builds peace by strengthening both" and patriotism of "prospering study and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. The global competition of education, technology and talents continues to intensify. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of “The Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Top Disciplines” not only demonstrates our confidence and determination to move forward from a big country of higher education to a solid country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How to efforts to rank among the world's first-class in a relatively short period of time, and speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap to achieve "overtaking on the bend"?
Besides resolute confidence in goals, paths, and capabilities, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: first, late-development advantages, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from advanced experiences of world-class universities, to radically improve their academic level and quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom connotation accumulated by the Chinese civilization for five thousand years, carry forward and develop excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and enhance image; third, system advantages, leverage the institutional superiority of a solid socialist country, strengthen target drive, pool consensus and synergy, optimize resource allocation, and provide sustainable means for schools to catch up with the leading international level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university like all schools. While giving full play to their advantages, each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on three outstanding features in running a school: firstly, accentuate the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, build an integrated education environment integrated with the integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, to create a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlight the characteristics of cross-discipline convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively foster interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-products; third, highlight the characteristics of university running systems and social services, and carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovating", the common values of "diligence, morality, discernment, and sincerity" and "letting the rivers and rivers, inspiring true virtues, pioneering people, and building our country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodies the mindset to "use all the talents in the world for me", and expresses itself as the acquisition of the high-quality concept of running and educating students at world-famous schools ; "Reason and Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should accept the cultivation of virtue and temperament along with the pursuit of truth; "削仁之心" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the spirit of seeking new knowledge and scientific research, and emphasizing that it should be reform and development and the commonwealth of the future with justice.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silent, and the wise see the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to the humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit, the spirit of the times and the national spirit stimulate each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

When NFT was out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to "Honor of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" brings a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. Besides having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I read a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest impression is the company's choice on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more; secondly, choose the industry that has good growth in the future, and consider the industry with best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry that has policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics are "do the things right", which is to do things right.
strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether to continuously deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking). For example, on improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can consider how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve correct campaign goals such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers. On enhancing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian American group sues Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools for admissions discrimination - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the three Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College discriminate against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet admission requirements for top American schools has doubled. But in these three prestigious American schools, the proportion of Asian Americans has remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in their so-called "general-based" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, a study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in the three colleges and universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentages of Asian-American applicants among all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after filing the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice would investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions after finding the facts.
They also hope that the complainants' universities will take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the parties involved in the complaint include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

Lin signed the "Building Sales Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be designated to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory sales contract within one week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
He finally picked the house, the deposit was paid, and the house price was ready, so it was only after the “close call” to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
Following trial, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract and could not be blamed on the defendant only. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for the deposit should not be applied to this case, and the defendant does not need to assume the breach of contract liability for double the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer reminder] You must exercise the necessary prudence and care in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should do the necessary prudence and care, for example, verify the house owner’s information, whether the house is occupied or not, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(DW Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders Democracy Summit" to "draw lines by ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and deceive its reality in the name of democracy, instigate division and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the US to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt both in the world and in the United States. For example, some leaders who were invited to the conference include some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the video democracy summit
The Chinese foreign ministry statement on Saturday said that "Today's American-style democracy became ill with its intensified problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and the division between the rich and the poor." American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the force of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He emphasized that democracy is not something to be taken for granted, "We have to constantly renew it in each generation, which in my view, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights around the world "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs champions to defend."
The United States has pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long initiative including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.

What is the red label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collecting, some like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. The red brand whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and the red brand whisky has won the gold medal of the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you are dousing it.
So how do you drink red label whisky?
Let me briefly introduce it to you.
How to drink red label whisky:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entry is rich and fresh, with hints of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be enjoyed straight over ice or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red label whiskey enters China, in order to adapt to the taste of Chinese people, red brand whiskey + sparkling drinks such as Coke or Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sour taste, can bring visual pleasure to people, and adding drinks to dilute the taste and change the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar can also), is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
Authentic Hong Fangwei tastes a little sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, and lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red brand whisky. You can try it as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Educational thinking: How to make "efighters" and "scumbags" get their own way - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect the confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the type of exam questions, so that the exam truly reflects the students’ actual level.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On a university campus, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels, combined with different levels of learning, with enormously different learning situations.
Assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hardCOS may pass the test. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, "students" can pass the test without any input or even get high marks; "students" usually never miss classes, their assignments and notes are good, and their exams are not much higher than that of the "excellent status".
It seems that the students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the university examinations are not without cause, I believe this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote directly.
In fact, everyone who has been to college knows that it is not uncommon to preempt共享 tests, seek various ways to "trick" test questions from teachers, try to delineate the scope of the test, and get "key tutoring" before the test. It is not uncommon to even carry cheat sheets and ask teachers to prove their valuable hand after the test.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, the qualification of a university examination depends on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
However, undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense. From a knowledge point of view, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learnt, and it is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally into question sets, then senior teachers in the discipline make up the examination paper, and the examination papers are also attended by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject, so that the duplication of examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of examination questions that conform to the facts of teaching and learning. The questions are based on the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of student learning so that the examination propositions can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type. It can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability assessment, and at the same time, innovatively designed the question type.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of exams are required, students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letter of advice from students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and post-course examination comparisons on self-checks, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper propositions and review links, refine the performance assessment, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single type of examination questions and repeated questions is a problem that the university examination affairs need to face. Of course, there needs to be a corresponding system. However, it is󠄡ṣday troubles and required teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation, both ends, teaching and learning will be more well connected, forming a positive interaction, and testing will also be more realistic, so that "cyclical masters" and "原始梦 Quins" will each have their own shares.
If I can't change the branch location for me, can I change to delivery instead?
So I don't have to give more money, right?
Colleague's order has been delivered

Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street) has no branch yet
Before taking the pictures, because our time was not arranged well, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
I chose to shoot on a weekend with good weather.
Mrs. Kim's staff, be it the consultant, makeup artist or photographer were amazing.
It was the first time in my life to actually wear makeup, wow~ I can't believe I will be so pretty one day lol.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient in their makeup and natural.
The exterior location was shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn’t feel cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and would immediately help us to organize anything in case of a little bit of trouble.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because we saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I did not want to let the customers delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, we really didn’t want to let us add photos at all. Of the 24 photos in the package, not a single photo was added. (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the seven thousand获胜 package. So I was shrill, and I was afraid that I would choose too much)
I have completed photos today and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them that were not very good, so they immediately fixed them for me.
Commissioning the photos my sister took before, I think I am really satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take a wedding photo with Mrs. Xuan Han Jin!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you and sincerely wish you happiness and a bright future!
How much is this set?

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificate because the special anti-counterfeiting paper is out of stock
KOTA KINABALU: The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the exhausted inventory of specially-made anti-counterfeiting papers, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to new born babies since the beginning of October, which has affected 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairou Aminus, assured that all the babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and that they will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At a press conference, he explained to an online media report that the issue of printing newspapers in Sabah had been running for 10 months.
He said the issue arose two months ago and Sarawak is also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers that produce special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to China."
He explained that the security paper used in Sabah birth paper is different from other regions, so it cannot borrow stocks from other states .
Kairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing.
"The bureau will send someone to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final phase of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will notify applicants to go to local branches to collect the birth certificate."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

48 hours nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone", the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document demanding strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia outbreaks in port cities, requiring personnel who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected with Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel who are traveling to a land border port city will conduct at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when each province, region and city determines the port city scope and announces it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities may study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission’s Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the differentiated management policies by different regions has transformed from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the border forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clustered outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notification pointed out that this has exposed the problems of untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, unimplemented closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, insufficient killing and sterilization of cold chain items, non-standardised management of centralized isolation sites, and lack of scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts should be made in nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the improvement of the weak points of port cities' prevention and control, and to do a scientific and accurate prevention and control work without relaxation and strengthen the anti-import defense line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronously research and deploy the epidemic prevention and control work with livelihood security work, publish and open the livelihood security hotline, regularly check for potential hidden dangers in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly address and actively respond to the prominent problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (regions, states, alliances) and the municipalities where they are located. The specific limits are determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and make announcements in a timely manner.

YouTube video shows the truth about U.S. bloodthirsty killings in 20 years - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on YouTube attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States starting the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing 20 years of military violence, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocents, and various crimes against humanity.
Abuse drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and set up killing teams.
For 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity fuels more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terrorism" war is "more counter-terrorism," .
The war did not bring hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Accidentally read the following article, discusses why this customer asks a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, from the perspective of commercial and shelf life. Although canning is deep processing and not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text here may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and have contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone must ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is better.
There are also consumers who respond after eating out of this mentality that the taste or taste of the cans is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why the canget is expensive. Where is the price?
Why is the price difference so big for the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, then what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising dollars every year. Where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: salesman in shopping malls, display fees at shopping malls, gift fees of products, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and are canned, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, unscrupulously linked with doctors in hospitals, and they assist in product promotion, and they get a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a listen.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow this method of operation. In fact, this practice is deceiving consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in the cans on the premise that you have a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing properties of the milk powder, which has no impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans and bags after opening is the same, it is just that the bags are not easy to keep after opening and are susceptible to moisture deterioration.
The food was delivered late, the food was cold, and it was dry and hard, so I couldn't eat it.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Most success books today preach "best principles"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you "what" you need to do.
It is like saying that the "how to do it" is actually the most important and fundamental link.
As such, all of these books have one thing in common – either do your best at it or do nothing at all; either 100 or 0; either you go to Mount Tai, or you just stay put.
This "best principle" will admit that it is "very true", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, start over, and make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to convention, conform to the old, and refuse to change, you have to yell "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will show their fear in front of the word "change", hold back and struggle to make up their minds; or on impulse, they will make a decision to "change" and take the first step bravely, but often things don't last long, they lose a competitive advantage if they persist for a while. It is hard to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting From Tomorrow" is a classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, and makes most people "stunned."
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way that might put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - which encourages a kind of "small wins for the big wins" theory, that is, if you can't achieved 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is supposed to make everyone succeed on the surface, it actually motivates a small number of people in the end; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, Dec. 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year, reaching 108,500 tons, an accumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial period of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to a large number of human-made hunting and the degenerate environment of naked carp breeding water, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a stagnant lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning of the main rivers and rivers of Qinghai Lake, and scientific and reasonable design of "fish passages", continuous efforts in protection are continued. The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million barley carps have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The Three Rivers source region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the eastward spreading of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Headwaters and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued prohibitions on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and constructed a comprehensive management system for a management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

I just saw an article about menstruation, it was too long.
science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, I will come regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the car will roll over in bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some people have less flow and some people have massive bleeding; some people don’t respond; some people feel pain until they are taken away by ambulances. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. The pain in the past does not mean the pain in the entire life.
The menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a few days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing I can do is to use a sanitary pad or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately when the menstrual period starts, before there is time to have dysmenorrhea, can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but it is useless to take it after the dysmenocorder begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, the period will basically have a period within two days.
It is best to replace the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it will easily breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, and if you add pre-prepared shipments, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify it here, the tampon does not need to be changed frequently, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal problems during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation period will also be unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is unfortunate, and the body will make mistakes for itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as excuses.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed lining of the uterus.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually gets thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is the house, and a house is built every month (stemmed lining) to be ready to welcome guests. When guests do not come, they are all demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day several days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But people can be born because his mother has menstrual period. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into being dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and the preparations that women's body makes to conceive life are disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up, stop thinking this way, the men who have never experienced it, will not experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and don't know what, how do you face your mother, you want your children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it really works.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, it is disappointing to send the wrong one.
Have to order another meal for the children
I hope the store is busy to check the products
Is it a leakage of electricity in the foot bath tub?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot care and health care. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people’s awareness of health care, foot baths are more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
In the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health appliances such as foot bath tubs are booming, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tubs, so there are certain hidden dangers.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but his feet felt numb when he was soaking his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, father still felt numbness on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen came on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he returned the foot tub, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that the already popular foot bath has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the maximum temperature setting, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what materials are guaranteed not to be harmful.
But in general, the foot bath will not have electrification problem, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take a pencil test.
The opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Hunan Daily Net - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the pursuit of the 100 billion tea industry goal.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of Huhong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into the "Five Colorful Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Hunans, four waters and five colors tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, dark tea, black tea have taken turns to develop, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, increasing the income of the majority of tea farmers.
Feng Shui turns, and black tea is powerful again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province say that after picking green tea and black tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has skyrocketed.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the license for the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua hailed "the origin of lake red".
In the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "Bing Lichun" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market more or less, but from the spot of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
The Xinhua tea has a touch of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, booming in popularity and trading, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can it be cancelled?

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the fundamental laws of philosophy that seek to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is taken from "Book of Changes:Xi Xian Shang" "the metaphysics is called Tao, and the metaphysical is called implement", which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji era) from the metaphysic.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method that does not say a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judging various moral views, and giving moral guidelines for the right or wrong behavior.
It studies what patterns of moral conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the science of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live, and summarizing observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the presumed theory, but investigates real choices made and observed by actual moral agents (moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to these decisions, and it examines the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part : the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part three: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th, British empiricist ethics, representative: Hume, 17-18th century, Continental rationalist ethics, representative: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative: Voltaire, etc., 18-19th century, German academic ethics, representative: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18-19th century, British utilitarianism et al., 9th century representative: Germanic Ethics, central 9th century representative). Gerin Heilfer et al.
Logic is a discipline that studies "principles and standards for valid reasoning and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is the subject of the study of the nature of beauty and its meaning.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, particularly the assistance that has not been interrupted since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name in early 1994.
Now, the old parents of most of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and got married.
It was your act of righteousness that helped us as families in distress through the most difficult time.
The new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating to our distressed family -- the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian relief campaign should have come to a close.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the Independencia Federation of Int'l America (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian aid, the IFCA and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executors of the projects often overlap.

The relief funds are often not delivered to the victims of the June 4th incident.
In 1994, following the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphans' Relief Fund for Two Orphans in Special Hardship", which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects mainly comes from the campus and social donations from June Fourth, generous donations from individuals, and the support of the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
Only last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the families of victims of the June Fourth finally received a part of the donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the June Fourth donation for the consideration of the donors. We are indeed some retired old people and our income is not as rich as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to “friends.”
We will respect the decision of our families to terminate the program within two years and resume immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous compatriots who have continued to give generously and risked humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you very much for choosing our products. Before you use our chips, please take 5 minutes to read the following carefully:
Please check whether the goods are complete after unpacking.
If there is any missing, please contact customer service in time.
The upper cover of the microfluidic chip is made of PC, and do not pass solvents that react chemically with PC.
Do not use the hand push syringe to inject directly into the chip, otherwise leakage will easily occur.
The microfluidic chips with common substrates pass the pure water test under the injection pressure of 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) before delivery.
Glass substrate chips pass the pure water test under 800mbar (100um channel) injection pressure before shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects during the process of using glass substrate chips, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
During use, please consider the viscosity of the solution and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause leakage.
For general substrate microfluidic microchip with pure water injected by syringe pump, we recommend that the flow rate be set below 150ul/min, and the oil phase flow rate should be set below 50ul/min.
Please increase your flow parameter value from slow to fast according to the viscosity of the actual injection liquid.
After the general chip is completed, please clean the internal channel in time, otherwise it will easily cause blockage.

Thank you Rabbit for your comment. I originally said that the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity and move forward, and we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really awesome. I highly recommend to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production are impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and will match your makeup according to your style, and the cosmetics are also made by big brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We are working in Beijing. Keyboard photo studios in Beijing need to line up half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues shot in Beijing, and after watching the finished film, I feel just so so.
I searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We have poor management of facial expressions, and I think this is also a short version of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post design, a good team.
When it came out, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have already recommended my girlfriend to go there, and my girlfriend was equally happy just after seeing the negative.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will find it and shoot it in their own style, not the same.
Thanks Zhan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both of them are very creative and innovative people. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting and meeting.
The sweet and caring assistant, and the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shoot, an unforgettable experience, and the result of shoot is much better than I thought. Thank you for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comment. It is also a kind of fate to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, I trust us so much of the distance of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet all of you. I have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I give the money?
The redelivered meal has been delivered
no rider receives
Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don’t have such an idea, it is best to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, the training institution will be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before you select an training institution, it is better to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from a major in computer science, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Many offline and online training institutions are actually good now, but firstly the cost of learning is high, and the second is more time investment, so you basically need 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now, many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources in Station B. If you are unable to find resources, you can also contact me through the presentation to get free resources, or give detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that the learning will not be very laborious, the teacher will explain in detail, and there will be someone to answer questions庞大 handy, and also you can assist in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referrals, and recommend to the company after study, so that later on, the interview process for job hunting can save a lot of trouble.
The above are some of my opinions, because I don't know your situation, I only give a general introduction and not detailed information. If you have anything else you want to consult, please feel free to contact me for communication.
I said come before 1 o'clock, I saw it in the app

Give me a chance, you will be satisfied. Quality means everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
All walks of life are not good right now!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!”
The plan of a day is in the morning, all the good things start in the morning. I hope you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health and success, and keep in a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, it means happiness if you possessed it; when you grew up, happiness is a goal, and you can achieve them; when you mature, you realize that happiness is a state of mind, and happiness is all understanding.
To be the truest and kindest self; to walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; walk one road in life, to take your own way; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and a beautiful old life!
At every stage of life, there are different challenges.
Many times, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to them, the problem will be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators jointly hold the first Saudi Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in Diriyah JAX art district in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places took part.
The Biennale is jointly planned by the Chatidourier Biennale Foundation and China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, and Tian Feiyu, curator of China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serves as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The exhibition spreading over an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as得太Experiment, Thinking on the Edge, Going to the Public, Brave New World, and On the Spirit of Art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, and these included paintings, installation art and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention, and some artists used recycled materials in novel ways. For example, in "Backstory Series of Endless Views and Mountains" (2014), Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste.
Barclay, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed his hope that the current biennale will build an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is twofold. It allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and to embrace Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Dec. 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment support for those out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies for promoting rural revitalization and rural public welfare jobs management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
Meeting the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to arrange poverty-stricken laborers and other rural groups to find employment, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people achieve employment and income, consolidate the achievements in poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the abilities of rural public services.
The new regulations are jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources钱之局, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly regulate the scope of target, fund management, job development, and job management of grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare personnel.
In terms of post development, the new regulations are clearly set up according to the principles of "set up employment when needed, appoint personnel by post, dynamic management, total amount control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management.”
The recruitment procedure must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, and the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that all rural public welfare post development departments should purchase commercial accident insurance for the rural public welfare post placement people; Relevant departments are required to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

2. Although the rightists have had a period of success in history, it was not long, so short because a little sunshine makes you bright, and a little water produces sweat; as soon as you splurge too, you will be able to prosper in Longwangshu, and if you are attacked, you will have nothing to do.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspect of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I dont completely agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I am very concerned about him, and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I think anti-necessary revolution. A revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to the people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries will take advantage of them.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who attempt to make amends by political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk left.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right’s words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the Left will not have this fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends who refuted the anti-thief and left-handedness, and they were really angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and the Zuoan, they are just filthy and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove us right, let alone let the rebels and left idiots admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the rebels call you fifty cents, and when the left man calls you right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal is moving away, and even the dragon slayer eventually turns into a dragon.
I think that left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China should be a left-leaning whole due to the innate genes of history and culture.
Currently the domestic right wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Right now, society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the conflict between China and the US will be split to the left. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just like it and it's over
Don't say anything, Huahua is so loyal
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US" companies.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies of allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, lowering R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers and causing a disorder in the global chip supply chain.
Today, the "lack of chips" has spread to major industries around the world. For example, car companies have stopped production and mobile phone prices have risen. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered severely.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", more and more technology giants in countries have begun to move toward "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control power and contain the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the old US has recently been making frequent moves, hosting the “chip summit”, and inviting giants of 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance and funding local technology giants in America. For example, American imperialist old technology giant Intel, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, spent US $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States and open the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for this is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the US Empire, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of personnel and technical reserves, and it will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising response. Regarding Intel's move to build a fab, Zhang Zhongmou said without hesitation: Intel is building a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still holds a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the U.S. imperialist manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the high-end semiconductor chips in the world had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
With the market demand, in the 1980s, the chip industry began to see division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had found Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously too self-centered and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then have to start wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic that Intel entered the foundry.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.

Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of Happy Dragon, the rate increase of Orion, the steal of goods, and the spread of public opinion to form a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look similar to the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak], [jag shape], and [cliff shape].
[Lone Peak] is artificial heating, quickly rushes to the list of hot searches, attracting public attention; [Jagged] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is on the hot search list; [Prevalence] is a mass withdrawal, and the hot search has used its “function”, received new tasks and rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event is exactly the trough of another event, the time is not inappropriate, so it must have been a unified batch of naval forces who received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which is in charge of popularizing, which diverts attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion and which coerces decision-making, and black accounts are inocks in batches and nodes and fine-tuned operations, taking almost all factors in the spread of public opinion into account.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
All walks will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

First cases of Omicron strain infection found in Mauritius and other countries - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12. Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency foreign correspondents reported: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant Omi Chron strain.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritian Minister of Health, Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius. He was in contact with a person who had recently been to South Africa and returned, and tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30.
After isolation and treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative and they have returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in the country.
All three are students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. They were all mildly ill and were not admitted to hospital.
In order to prevent the spread of the Ormicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter by air will have to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in Thailand.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating Pfizer’s new crown vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has detected three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.

Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 South Huancheng Road
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at it. At first my budget was 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
Coming to the store, a series of tricks began.
It was the first time I went to the store and I just showed them my layout. They didn’t go to measure the house on site, but they can actually quote me that my 135 house is less than 70,000 yuan. They probably showed me their materials and I didn’t know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that as long as you come to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you will never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
There were a lot of problems in his quote he gave me 70,000 does not include plumbing and utilities, not including any doors and cabinets, bathroom, and these three are the bulk of the cost of decompression.
Apart from these, their service point charges are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign the contract without making it clear at the beginning.
When I went to them to refund the money they seemed experienced and have a small team to deal with you.
Anyhow, the bite to death is the client's problem and they are totally not responsible.
All kinds of shirking the responsibilities, and there are many details. I do not want to talk about them all. I will be in tears. In short, don’t choose them, because the house my friends find them to decorate is of poor quality, and I will give you all kinds of expenses later.
Darn, they are the original deceiving leading decoration, and now they are changed to Damei, it seems that it has closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a foolish decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you can look at these on Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a merchant a question, please log in or register first
It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews. For details, please refer to the merchant acceptance statement
The public comment Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as Damei 360 integrated home improvement address, phone number, business hours, etc. To find a decoration company decoration company, just go to public comment
This is so scary, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Ok, then don't cancel this conversation, and if you don't refund me within 5-10 days, you'll be held accountable.
I asked if I could cancel in less than 15 minutes

Starry sky promises 丨 Gemini meteor shower ushered in a great on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a perfect date on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomical science expert, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow, rich in color, and there are a lot of fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly overhead) invoiced for 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Beautiful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the highlights will be reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the lunar month. The moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the middle of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the late hours of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to keep warm and cold.”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon has set before you can see it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower is very large in all directions, so you do not need to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower consistently.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a brilliant “meteor shower blockbuster”, it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or the laser TVs themselves are products for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets users’ needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
The Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and ophthalmologist of Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
With more and more attention to eye health, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant drop in the price of LCD TVs, most of the prices of laser TVs currently available on the market are more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price has gradually climbed.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
Definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It’s not about pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for video players. If you want to take into account the large screen and lack of viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and after weighing it, you can judge for yourself because you are afraid to hear one side’s word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle close focus projector - laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a microscopic Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection vendors use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light to the eyes. You diffuse reflection on the ceiling, and you cannot see it. If you insist on being more realistic, LCD TVs also emit "", so when you turn on the TV, won't the ceiling also be illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be an image at all.
Just the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain curtain is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

After adding the WeChat appointment date, the lady will send me the optional time schedule, and the reply information will be more timely~
Before I went there, I saw the shooting works in the store, which were more of the outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my youngest sister, and very patiently tried two sets of clothes that I was struggling with. I finally decided to start making up and styling ~ The photographer will set some props before shooting, guide the movements, and improve every detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas with me, the style I took was not the style I wanted, but it should be beautiful🙊🙊势力
After the shooting, the photographer will help to choose the photos and communicate the post-production style, which is very careful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, wait for the effect~
The second time I won the photo-like overlord meal event~ Most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece for photo shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s and I still feel a little green. I hope customer can give more advice on the instructions of filming activities in the future~ Quite chatty, and the shooting process is quite pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio preferred quality store
On the home page, let's take a look at Queenie~
When I arrive at the store, I fill in the name and phone number and choose clothes. I can choose wedding dresses, and it is quite patient after changing three or four outfits. After choosing, it takes a long time to make makeup and the service attitude is also good. Later on filming will teach you how to pose, but when I take photos, I feel that my face is very big. It takes half a month for the intensive repairs and it was sent in three or four days, and it feels as if it is no different from the original film.
[Environment] Overall is good.
Lots of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and inside is a photo studio.
[Service] Very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make up.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit too much, the original double eyelid was pasted with triple eyelids.
The end of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't thrush eyebrows every day.
The photos are given in ten days, but the effect of the P drawing is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I didn’t know what style I wanted, I tried two sets and I chose a black dress. The lady said that this set is more Hepburn retro-inspired
After choosing the clothes, I started to apply makeup and hair. The hair stylist and the makeup artist are super patient and help me get it done. I am very satisfied with the result.
After my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer guided me to pose throughout the whole process, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four favorite shots for intensive cultivation. The little brother said that the film will be finished within 15, and the ending is very satisfying~
No reply for 3 days... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system does not recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
I now have to pay shipping every time
Can you waive it first, and then charge my monthly fee after your investigation, is that possible?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the viewpoint of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage firm, three key words must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major violation record in the last 3 years, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually harsh, they all involve having abilities, in order to be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good manner. As a small umbrella insurance of an insurance brokerage company, the insured does not have to ask too much into question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are three thresholds that not all insurance companies can establish.
At this point, it is not bad and is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many company’s star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claimant and the insurer are Hetai Life Insurance, and Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the payment mode: Internet platform products discount the operation costs of operating outlets and the cost of salesperson wages, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of insurance policyholders, and at the same time maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the professionalism point of view of clerks: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can apply for insurance themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or fit, so that there are many hidden dangers in claims and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done telephone sales of insurance on “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible for here.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million, buy insurance to get a mobile phone, receive 60,000 critical illness insurance coverage for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid major issues. They will not tell the policyholder that the first month 1 yuan and the next month, you need to pay a unchanged fee, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct the fee for a year or two and they are unclear what they paid for.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent from the special policy number segment of the policy tail number such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be converted by科学研究 and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured.) The 60,000 critical illness insurance value for free is short-term. If you rely only on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of a serious illness, what can you do, and can not solve the problem, your life in the future will start to run away.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So in general, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should comprehensively consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself, underwriting offline products, and each person saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker who has 3 years experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly one thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing an insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance placement, I will shop around for customers, and try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will organize insurance policies for customers and manage褶 them so that customers can feel at ease.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured.
Although the Internet insurance does not have a very “ceremony”, it may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line of "telephone sales", but there is a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, which is-the follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When we are buying insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can stay with us for a long time and provide us with services after many years?

thank you for your help
From the past to now, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such acts of personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must stop this villain.
If you ignore political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style of work.
To the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to teasing posts, to your attempt to put my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but you continued discouraging with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, shape, good childbirth, and somewhile other messages such as how to plant strawberries in bed, and whether or not to intervene.
How can I know that later, I even received multiple messages from friends about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friend account and remarks with sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't be silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes,you can continue to be ridiculed and obscure,humiliating, abusive, you can continue to say that you just love and follow me,you can continue to think this it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny it is not your drawing or continue to make any offensive statement.
Yes, I cannot, and have no ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there is a girl who would be so shamed in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut off part of the message for you to comment
No one can pretend to be you in your own posts
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization

The Three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Multi-dimensional reports by pro-CCP media: the latest news on Sino-US relations:The latest satellite imagery shows that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US轴承 media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the US aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean include the USS Abraham Abraham (USS Abraham Lincoln) which departed from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
The three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers were massing around China.

(Weibo@南海Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China on a rare visit to Guam, an analysis said, which is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," which also includes siloed ballistic missiles in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting with friends about the recent Meta plunge of 26%, wiping away $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he is "facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps add ads from Meta, and realize monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. The normal response of most people is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs it again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta has about several hundred people in the Hong Kong office, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte’s TT is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it certainly won't be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning cash overseas on a massive scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem isn't just declining revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly, what is the future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don’t look at the beauty of Facebook now, it also has an annual revenue of US$100 billion to 200 billion. In fact, Facebook is very sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.工件.
回家 Although several of his social software have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but facing the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion is also the blink of an eye.
This elusive concept of the metaverse has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg is changing the company’s name and is also constantly looking for new tracks.感到几家 其中， However, I think his choice of track was wrong, and it is a point of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
