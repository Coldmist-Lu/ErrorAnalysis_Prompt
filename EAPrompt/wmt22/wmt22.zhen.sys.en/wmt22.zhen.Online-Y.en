The research results of students singing the lead role at the Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference make people brain-Xinhua
Use air to wash your hands, judge diseases in one breath, and accurately search for the source of haze Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. Their research covers various fields such as the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education, etc. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
Zhang Diming's team, a PhD student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a smartphone biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
“You only need to take a gentle breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health status from the components of the gas you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming explained that this sensor set is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor set uses a new material such as graphene. Its target is a chemical element, and its keen “sense of smell” allows it to reflect physical health more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eye
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
“The lack of early detection and resection of many diseases is related to the lights used in doctors' operating rooms. ”
Shin Junfei said, for example, during an early cancer examination, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue clearly in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates. By adjusting the spectrum, the distinction between different tissues under light is enhanced.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, etc., and received good feedback.
In October of last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, wiping soap at most, and squeezing hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of “air hand washing devices.”
As long as we stand on the sink of the device, our body weight can compress the air out.
“It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! ”
Color development and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing hands.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top schools and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - a first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I think is important in addition to a driver's license!
Popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time left for the ambulance to arrive after the accident, and it is this period that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I actually had a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window of our lives would only be four minutes, golden four minutes!
That's why people around you understand how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls down, we can rescue him through our expertise instead of standing there motionless and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is so scary.
“In China, our official data shows that 3 million people die unexpectedly every year. The most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the US, an average of 15% can be saved.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, 780 percent can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.”
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Response, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, and no heartbeat, there is no effect on you choking people.
Artificial respiration and chest compression are necessary to save people.
I found that few of us now have this kind of awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner when faced with an emergency.
Maybe it can also save a person's life!
You can register for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. Students still have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I have to complete before I'm 25 years old. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but it was done!
Next, I'm going to take the other certificates I want to take. I'm planning to take a diving certificate. I saw in Xiaohongshu before that there was also a diving first aid certificate. It seems like you still have to have a first aid certificate to take the exam, so in fact, a first aid certificate is still very useful!

Let's start with the conclusion. Personally, I think “All Seas” is an all-round bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you want to say whether this movie has a highlight or not, then it's not at least the soundtrack selection is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. It's one that allows you to sleep soundly in a movie theater, and one that fills you with anger after watching it. “All Seas” is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted when it comes to insulting the audience.
What makes people feel the most painful about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a Gram novel. It's hard to name, and has many loopholes like a trench coat on Brother Pony's body.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of poop.
First, let's briefly talk about some of the episodes that I find difficult to understand.
The male owner's place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to watch the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father are still very relieved about this.
Then this old man didn't have the following.
How did the hostess get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the little bastards of the Island Speed Party easily close a section of mountain road??
Then the truck that sent the steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't find it around.
The feeling of this prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small mixed speed party with no credit information and be suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of why usury loans didn't call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card at a hotel, and then forcibly arranges that he can't find the hotel owner and sleep outside the door of his room for a night's sleep?
This inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, and it pains me when the plot is so outrageous that I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the main theme of the movie, or the movie doesn't have a main theme at all, which is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you guessed it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through watching it, you thought it might be a drama film that wanted to reflect the hard survival of young people in a small town. After watching it, you didn't know exactly what you watched at all. With that, you had deep doubts about yourself, why should you go to the cinema to enjoy poop during the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to film a motorcyclist, then inspiration+comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie succeeded step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then honestly talk about the grudges between young people in town who like to ride motorcycles and waiter girls.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot cannot show anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yoon Jung, whose new motorcycle was burned, and then he was able to sing), he couldn't open up some brain holes that Kennedy couldn't even stop watching.
As for the heroine who is clearly not mentally retarded, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Also, I really don't understand why Han Han, as a racer, is so keen to add crash episodes to his own movies?
Are movies like this scheduled in the Spring Festival program to add blockages to the audience?

Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Enrollment Is a Prospective Employee of an Enterprise-Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot a “modern apprenticeship” talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students receiving pilot training will also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-registered as unit employees of the pilot enterprises.
Municipal Education Commission requires, standardize secondary vocational school enrollment and enterprise employment procedures, clarify the dual status of apprentices secondary vocational school students and enterprise prospective employees, in accordance with the two-way selection principle, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, for apprentices aged 16 and above but not 18 years old, must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and specific positions, teaching and training of apprentices on the job Contents , protection of rights and interests, etc.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training plans, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot uses the training academic system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The induction internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, an enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city identified 60 municipal middle vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches. The number of each pilot was about 50, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implementation, and gradual promotion from point to point, the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint school-enterprise enrollment, joint training, and integrated education of people is explored, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of students' counterparts.

South African doctor: Omik Jung has strong transmission power, but most of them are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omik Jung variant of the coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press report, with the spread of the Omik Jung variant in South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors from Gauteng Province in South Africa formed a physicians' organization to report that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have relatively mild symptoms, such as physical pain and cough, and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have yet to be hospitalized.
“They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine,” Pillay said. ”
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to become seriously ill due to coronavirus infection.
He said that in comparison, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated “had trouble breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days”.
Two weeks after Southern Africa first reported the Omiquillon mutated strain, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by South Africa's National Institute of Infectious Diseases: Of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% were seriously ill, half the severe rate of the previous wave of the epidemic; the average length of hospitalization was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and of the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, and of the early outbreaks in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: “Currently, almost all indications indicate that it is a milder disease. ”
He also said, “It's still early days, and we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we only entered this wave of the epidemic for two weeks. ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalizations, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the main COVID-19 strain in the world, Omikjon cases are occurring in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests showed that the Omik Jung variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What do we rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service advertising slogan “No killing without buying or selling”, then in a favorable environment where there is no demand for “abduction”, mass prevention and control and anti-abduction by the whole population make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and expensive, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, an emergency release platform for information on missing children developed by the Abduction and Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went live.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app was called “Reunion”, I felt very warm.
The new technological means are not only named “literature and art” and are full of feelings, but informatization is also properly used, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against abduction is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be cited as many “big words”.
However, before abduction and trafficking cases come to an end, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Prioritize matters. Under the urgent purpose of “rescue”, topics that are widely divided and controversial, such as “whether child abduction and trafficking should always be the death penalty”, can be put aside and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on their experience in investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as they succeed.
If the abduction hunt is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the “Reunion” platform that directly helps to detect cases and recover children.
After all, “abduction” is a major task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
Combating crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the meticulous enforcement of the law, there is no need to implement the care of “caring for young children and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a train station, parents are asleep, and only wake up to find that the child is gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a fair sense of protection.
Both parents taking turns resting or placing the child under secure protection are the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
Looking at the other side of the police's fight against abduction and trafficking crimes, parties that buy abducted children should also receive attention and punishment.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and property confiscation will be imposed.
The sentence is high and the maximum sentence is heavy. Under the general trend of “light punishment”, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is clearly a crime with heavier penalties.
However, there are still quite a few cases of abduction and trafficking that occur every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in their views on raising children and have little legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely on strict government enforcement alone.
If there is a widespread “market” for abduction, abductors and traffickers are tempted to profit, continue to innovate methods of abduction and trafficking, and form a “fight” situation with law enforcement officials, the anti-abduction operation is bound to fall into an inefficient muddle.
Therefore, breaking down the concept of backwardness and popularizing common sense of the law will also help root out the crime of abduction, trafficking and buying of children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, virgin olive oil (virgin olive oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or refined olive oil), with five levels.
Extra virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is an oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
Depending on the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is an all-natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and pleasant botanical aroma, and an acidity of no more than 1%.
Premium virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are fair, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining extra virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or “secondary oil”.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a percentage of extra virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color. It has an acidity of less than 1.5% and is transparent, light golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive Pomace Oil): Olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution and refined.
If you have read the grade classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You need to know that olive fruits are just like grapes that make wine. Olive fruits from different regions and varieties of olive fruits produce olive oil of different standards.
The best places to grow oleocanthal:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for oleocanthal growth, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity, and precipitation.
Other than the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be cultivated sporadically in suitable habitats.
Main regions of origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. Similar climates are Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. far south latitude.
The month in which oleocanthal is harvested:
Every year, March to June is the time when the oleocanthal tree blooms and sets fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
The nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered one of the most nutritious oils found to date.
Democracy summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online “Summit for Democracy” (Summit for Democracy) (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by 110 governments around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, ended on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the 2nd global “democracy summit” next year.
Taiwan government representative and government councilor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said, “We know how arduous the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is ubiquitous.
Authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish the flames of freedom that are burning in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
“As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, forces that are more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to blatantly pursue power before the public interest,” he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the “Democracy Summit” were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with “International Human Rights Day”.
UN Secretary General Guterres also said in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
“Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. ”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
“For a long time, the world has always been affected by the rise of China, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable,” he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority. ”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
He said, “Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, or maybe some of you don't realize the threat [the Chinese Communist Party] is to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. ”
While attending a roundtable discussion on “Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values”, Tang Feng, government member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released the “National Statement” via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of confronting authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight COVID-19 through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said, “At a time when democracy in Taiwan is on the rise, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and the collective interest, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we can overcome fake information without being removed from the shelves. ”
At the same time as the schedule for the second day of the “Democracy Summit” was underway, the US Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, in accordance with the law, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company recognized as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken sent from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a practitioner at a similar price first.
It's not friendly. In fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell, then the normal situation that is expensive will be more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of “starter shot” is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the beat, the vibration is very high, the hard ball cannot be topped, and it is difficult for a master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is — tennis is so difficult. I know if you can't learn it, and I also know that you can't bear to buy expensive ones and fool you with a bargain. If you play twice, you won't play again. So this beat is cheap, and you don't feel distressed either.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you have progressed. When the time comes, you will come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand racket at a similar price, and choose Prince or Dunlop's. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't be sold for a price either. A new 500 or 600 would be fine. A second-hand 200 yuan, isn't it pleasant to have a 1,000 yuan racket?
It's very friendly to newbies, but as soon as they pass the novice stage, they have chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the novice stage.
Order has been delayed several times
Can you help me follow up?
postponing
thanks
That is to say, I actually already have credit?

In fact, a lot of attention is paid to how girls with slightly fat bodies dress and match.
Girls with fat bodies can't wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length is about the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the obesity on the legs.
Being too long gives people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear it in three sections, the top, middle, and bottom, it will appear that you are naturally taller. That is, the upper body, skirt, and stockings are used in different colors, and you will look slender.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for chubby girls (the author deeply appreciates this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body weight. Noble and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially short black skirts, can make people think you're thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So as not to make people feel obese when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fat, be sure to tell you tips on how to dress and match well.
Chubby girls should never wear tight skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which makes people look very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind of fine plaid oh), choose a printed flared skirt with a soft texture, with a swinging top, can cover up the shortcomings of fat girls well.
Of course, chubby girls also pay attention to wearing short skirts.
When fat girls wear short skirts, they should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt, so that your fat figure will have the effect of increasing height.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look slimmer, which is the most IN match in summer!
If you are an MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, I recommend choosing a gorgeous short dress.
It not only covers your big belly, but also shows your strengths.
The A-line skirt will be very thin, and it is more suitable for fat girls. If you choose a tighter top, it will be thinner to form a sense of hierarchy.
A simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, and fat MM can also be tried.
Chubby girls can also wear a sense of fashion.
Girls who are as fat as long as they can master the rules of dressing and matching well will also be the focus of attention.
After the change in dressing and matching, you also need to exercise more in your life and try to break away from the label of a slightly fat girl one day earlier 😄

Girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: “It's okay to think it's sarcasm” - Xinhua
A girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou stood in front of a large wooden board with the words “human target, ten yuan, one arrow” written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of “Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister” blew up the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Wulin Square in Hangzhou standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person. The words “human target, ten yuan, one arrow” were written on the board, signaling passers-by to use a bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
The act triggered a buzz among netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to Xinjing News reporters that the police confirmed that the girl made such an aggressive move only to raise money for her sister, but this kind of behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street “arrow target” fundraising admonished
In the picture circulated online, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large wooden board in the font “one”. The words “human target, ten yuan, one arrow” were written on the board in black ink. Her bank account number, WeChat, Alipay account, etc. were written on the other wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a “begging act of Bo's eyeballs,” and many netizens also expressed sympathy for this.
“We discovered what we discovered when we patrolled the square at around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were already quite a few onlookers. ”
Police officers at the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stalls, both around the age of 20, and dressed up young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who works as a “human target” has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; the other girl is on the side to help sipping, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery now, so please help everyone.
“We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told Xinjing News reporters that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and raised donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since treatment still costs more than 300,000, it was impossible to think of a good way to raise funds for a while, and only then did this act be carried out.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target and the other was responsible for laying hands, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone watched and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police assessed by the public security department that the bow and arrow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, “This kind of blog eyeball fundraising method is not advocated.”
She had already left the police station after being warned by the police station residents.

What is the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt that it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article called “Quick Look! The article “Olympic Games Where Project Managers Can Hit Gold Medals” is very popular. It mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects. No one can match it: moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late is a daily routine for project managers. Fighting fires, carrying pots, and apologizing is not a problem.
An article that seemed like a joke and ridicule also revealed the daily bitterness of project managers. Behind it, it represented a lack of effort in the current project management work.
And people working in project management are also gradually choosing to get themselves out of trouble at work through some actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional) applicants each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the “China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019)”, as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified about 420,000, and the number of valid licensees was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® licenses worldwide.
The number of PMP licensees has increased year by year in the past 10 years, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that it is no longer advisable to simply copy past “old experience” to do things. The rapidly changing work environment tells us that we need to learn and stand on the shoulders of science giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that project management is smooth and unhindered?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the relevant knowledge points such as the top ten areas of project management and the five major process groups, but it is still a mess when actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following issues: poor project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, no idea how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, inability to land in the work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, project delays; unclear division of labor among members, “old fritters” in the team do not know how to deal with poor cross-departmental assistance communication , the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than 10 years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won honorary titles such as “China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base”, came with the “R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp” online course.

Jiexin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of “Double 12” - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website
This year's “Double Eleven” carnival nationwide online payment business transaction amount reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared to previous years.
A wide variety of red envelopes have been reduced, and the eye-catching live streaming of goods has once again allowed consumers to shout for benefits. On the one hand, this consumer boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is getting stronger and stronger, and on the other hand, they also have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and mainstream contemporary consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of “Double 12”, Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Jiexin”) issued a rational consumption initiative, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumer awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the “Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report” released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have performed well at the level of financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and “one old, one young” will continue to be the focus of financial education. The “Report on the Debt Status of Young People in China” released by Nielsen and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, with 86.6% of young people They all use credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is very different from the label of “excessive splurge” labeled by the outside world, some young people do consume excessively and follow the trend. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks have arisen, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave in assuming social responsibility and conducting positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and responding positively to regulatory calls to raise consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people, with practical actions.
Over the years, Jiexin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for youth groups including university students. Through various forms such as innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top institutions in China, Jiexin has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people in various forms, such as innovative practice competitions, etc., to help them establish a rational consumption concept, rationally plan consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of Double 12, Jiexin reminded all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings about consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
Be sure to plan ahead when spending, and repay on time if you can.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect future economic life such as buying a car or a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and iterated financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can trust for life.

Vietnam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “unity and stability.”
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
The Arab countries of the Gulf to resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar stem from the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, with the aim of meeting common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman this time, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) — an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab countries for believing it impossible to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and Iran's nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to take no action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia and Iran engaged in direct negotiations against the backdrop of nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failing to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity and, at the same time, to propose measures for the full cooperation of its member States in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is claimed that the Xinshan District Super Run has the loudest exhaust sound!
The car our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship super car, Murcielago's replacement model — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is close to MYR 2 million. A year's road tax is ten thousand MYR. It's four-wheel drive. Why is it called the LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, if you forget it, Xiaobian doesn't know. The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. Probably Xiaobian's MyVI will reach 100km/h when it's 30km/h, huh.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine with unobstructed views under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say much about the car model description. Just Google it yourself. Xiaobian has compiled some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
It's so much attention that everyone is watching everywhere they go, and it's very uncomfortable! (It's actually a bit cool)
The cost of 1 km of fuel is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine is so loud that you will be deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's still cool)
The car body is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a normal parking space, and I'm afraid the car next door will knock when it opens the door!
It's a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (Xiaobian said it himself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the super run in this video isn't going to be sold, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!

It led to a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I'm sure riders all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911 is also priced at one million!
A few days ago, in just a few minutes, a million sports cars were knocked out abroad, 911, and tens of millions of super cars, Chiron!
Looking at the results, it makes sense that it's expensive!
Let university spirit resonate with zeitgeist at the same frequency-Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of ideas and value pursuits that a university has accumulated over a long period of time during its development. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university has been essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in China, it emerged in the fall of national distress, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the value concept of “Ming De Ji Shi, repairing the peace” and the patriotism of “developing a strong country”.
Currently, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. Global competition in education, science and technology, and talent continues to intensify. As an important “supply side”, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the “Overall Plan for Coordinated Promotion of the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines”, while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move from a major country with higher education to a higher education power, also places higher and newer requirements on university development.
How can we strive to rank among the most popular in the world in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis that there is still a certain gap, and achieve “overtaking cars in corners”?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, self-confidence in path, and self-confidence in ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, latecomer advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of running schools; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to unite strength. Shaping the brand and enhancing the image; the third is to give full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven, gather consensus and joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is important to realize that building a world-class university cannot be one of a thousand schools. While giving full play to its advantages, each school must show its individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school traditions, and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, and to build an integrated and nurturing environment integrating science and education and school-enterprise to form a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment where disciplines intersect, and actively cultivating cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic intersecting achievements; third, Highlight the characteristics of the school running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of an industry-university-research cooperation system at Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit so that the university spirit and the zeitgeist resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of “seeking truth and innovation”, the common values of “studying diligently, practicing morality, discerning, and being truthful” and “the Haina River, enlightening the truth and virtue, opening things up to the people before us, and building our country” together form the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, continuously accumulate cultural heights, and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, “Haina River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mind of “the world's talents for my use”, and manifests itself in drawing on the high-quality concept of world-famous schools to run schools and educate people; “enlightenment and virtue” emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and the best spirit of kindness, which means that universities are more motivated by virtue and personality while pursuing truth; “opening things before people” embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including The search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research also manifests itself in reform and development, revolutionizing the past; “Shoring Our State” emphasizes patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share common honor and humiliation with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year run school.
“The wise hear silently, and the wise see the invisible”.
Chinese colleges and universities should further build on the overall cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the direction of the times and historical mission in which higher education undertakings are located, and accelerate their construction into world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university stir up each other with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the prosperity and strength of the country and the revitalization of the nation, and the realization of the common ideals

At a time when NFTs are rapidly coming out of the loop, a new concept has popped up in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called “Axie Infinity” had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn a stable income from the game.
“Axie Infinity” is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology. It combines a variety of ways to play, including NFTs. It is currently the most traded NFT project, exceeding US$3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than US$8.2 million a day, directly forcing “King's Glory”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially claimed that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of “Axie Infinity” will pass on a new “palytoearn” model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character. In addition to being able to get fun and financial benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of the target industry. First, choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion dollars; secondly, choose an industry with good growth in the future, consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to “do the things right”, that is, to do things right.
The strategy is to “do the right thing”, that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, in addition to how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or expanding horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, on top of increasing customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to improving event participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right event KPI to achieve the right Campaign goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new ones; in addition to improving DAU (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, made Bitcoin legal tender. This is the first time Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved Proshares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market, and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin implemented a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which increases the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduces the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment at 3 prestigious Ivy League schools including Yale-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of May 23 from Washington D.C. (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest against discrimination against Asian applicants in the enrollment process at three prestigious Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of prestigious American schools has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities “consistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong explained that research by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that in these three colleges and universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have imposed a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect that after filing the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment after determining the facts.
They also expect the colleges and universities complained of to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their enrollment policies for Asians.
Currently, the three colleges and universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in admissions from Harvard University, but the US Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups participating in the complaint this time, educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani origin in the United States were also included.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the plant, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the “Plant Sales Deposit Receipt”, which states, “If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit goes to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. The two parties agree to sign a contract for the sale and sale of the plant within one week.”
However, since then, the two sides failed to agree on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the plant and the payment method, etc., which led to delays in signing the housing sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
When the deposit was paid and the housing payment was ready, it was almost impossible to sign the contract “on the doorstep”, but the seller didn't sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After the hearing, the court found that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract in the end could not be attributed only to the defendant. It should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations had not been successful. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant was not liable for breach of contract for double the return of the deposit.
After the verdict in the first instance, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original sentence.
[Lawyer Reminder] Necessary duty of caution should be exercised during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer must exercise the necessary duty of due diligence, for example, to verify the information on the owner of the house and whether the house is occupied, etc., and clarify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese.com) After the “Democracy Summit” ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a speech on Saturday (December 11) saying that the United States held the “Leadership Democracy Summit”, which “drew ideological lines, instrumentalized democracy, weaponized, and acted as anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incited division and confrontation, and diverted domestic contradictions”.
The Chinese government believes that “for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
“Democracy” has long become a “weapon of mass destruction” for America to interfere with other countries.
The summit was Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was conducted via video. Leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend the conference, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US for having problems with America's own democracy, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also questioning voices internationally and within the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies were criticized for being invited to the conference, such as leaders of countries such as the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some suspected that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Scholz, who just took office, also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
A statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, “Today's American-style democracy is sickening. Problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, and polarization between rich and poor are intensifying.” America's democracy is a “rich man's game” based on capital.
US President Joe Biden said in his speech, “As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, forces that are more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to blatantly pursue power before the public interest. “
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. “We must constantly update it with every generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time. “
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights “need fighters to defend in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges”.
The US side promised to launch a one-year action after this democracy summit, including a US$424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, “Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year”.
OK, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address
Nissho Restaurant (Gudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Environment: Moderate [Service Bell] Service: Serve quickly “Gufa Mala Cake” My must-order dish Mala cake is too fragrant, too soft, and so delicious 😋 Friends who like desserts must try the “Dongjiang Cuttlefish Slip-Stuffed Tofu Pot” The soup is very tasty and the tofu is very tender...
Good taste, good meat, warm service
I haven't been to Richang for a long time. Fruit fishing is still so tasty & the real material is enough. The first time I ordered a char siu bun was the southern taste of the soft flour I love!
The claypot rice is just right dry and wet, and the portion is very large. The signature tin foil chicken wings are as always praised, the soup is good, and the kale is handled relatively well...
Good taste, warm service, good meat
The old store in Richang was also an influencer many years ago. It was a small building in Dongdan, with wooden floors.
It always takes a long time to eat claypot rice at the door, and the casserole of claypot rice is cracked...
I haven't been to Richang for several years, and the rise of Cantonese cuisine in various small restaurants has distracted the flow of traffic.
It's rare to have a seat when you arrive at the store. If you say the food is of poor quality, it's as good as always.
Good taste, good meat, staple food
Nissho takeout.
[Rice] Meal: I was a little disappointed with the dish this time.
Three cups of chicken: a little more side dishes, a little less chicken.
The taste of the main flavor is a bit biased. The bottom flavor is not salty enough, which highlights the sweetness. You can make up for sweetness+various spice side dishes...
What is the way to drink red brand whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect, some like food, and of course others like wine tasting. Red Brand whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and the Red Brand whiskey has won a gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of red brand whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, wouldn't it ruin its mellow aroma.
So how do you drink red brand whiskey?
Xiaobian will give you a brief introduction.
How to drink red brand whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Whisky is a blend of about 35 Scotch whiskies. It has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional scotch whiskies, with sweet and smoky aromas in the rich aroma.
The mouth is rich and fresh, with hints of vanilla and strong smoky malt.
You can drink it directly with ice, or mix it with your favorite drink.
Red whiskey has entered the country. In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, sparkling drinks such as red brand whiskey+cola or Sprite or Novice have become an enduring fashion.
In addition to neutralizing the sour taste, these sweet drinks are visually pleasing. Adding them to the drink has the effect of diluting the taste and changing the taste.
Red whiskey+sliced lemon+sugar cube (sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
Authentic Red Fang Wei has a slightly sour taste. Adding sugar neutralizes the sour taste, while lemon brings a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweet acidity can be adjusted according to personal tastes and tastes.
The above three are the best ways to drink red whiskey. You can try them as a reference. I hope Xiaobian's introduction can help you.
Educational Thoughts: How to Make “School Bullies” and “Learn Slag” Get Their Own Place in College Examinations-Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to university leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university exam, and making demands to make the exam more difficult and change the exam question type so that the exam can truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university exams have been a “hot topic” for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, and their ability levels vary. Coupled with varying degrees of study, the study conditions vary greatly.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question type is single and the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not have any merit may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on surprise attacks before the exam. If they think about other methods, they may achieve the effect of doing more with less.
As a result, there is a “strange status quo” where “learning slag” can usually pass the level without investing, and even get a high score; “school bullies” usually never drop out of class, their homework and notes are good, and exams are not much higher.
In this way, students at Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems that exist in university examinations are not without cause, and I believe this situation does not only exist at Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these 3 students who wrote straight letters.
In fact, everyone who has attended university knows that it is not uncommon to surprise exam preparation, find various ways to “extract” exam questions from teachers, try to draw the scope of the exam, and get “key counseling” before the exam. It is not unusual to even include a small copy in the exam and ask the teacher to exalt himself after the exam.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring whether or not a university exam passes or fails depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many major courses focus on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether you have a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university exam.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, “I studied the basic knowledge of mathematics at university 20 years ago, and I'm still studying it now, which is still the focus. ”
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean that the exam question type is single or the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, examination groups are generally formed, and examination papers are co-ordinated by senior teachers of the subject. Examination papers are also read with the participation of all teachers in charge of the subject, so that repetition of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning. According to the overall situation of students' learning, the questions are easily distributed normally. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the students' degree of learning, so that the exam propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability test, and innovate the question type.
The exam is the baton of university education. If there is any kind of exam, students will have a corresponding exam preparation plan. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University campus attaches great importance to the students' proposal letters and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct discussions and comparative self-checks on course closing examinations, formulate exam paper propositions and related systems. At the same time, they strengthen supervision and inspection of exam paper propositions and review links, refine the evaluation of results, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Mechanically solving the problems of single test question type, repeated topics and other issues that university examinations need to face. Of course, a corresponding system needs to be introduced, but kung fu is expensive on a daily basis, requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation, both ends thoroughly, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a virtuous interaction, the exam will also be more in line with reality, so that the “school bully” and “Learn slag” Each has its own place.
If I can't change the location of the branch for me, can I change to delivery?
Then I don't have to pay more, right?
Colleague's order has been delivered

What about GPS? It's not there
Mrs. Kim Wedding Photography (South Street Store) doesn't have a branch yet
Before the photo was taken, we changed the time twice because we didn't schedule our time. Consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us schedule the time.
Later, I chose a weekend shoot when the weather was nice.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists, and photographers, are amazing.
That was the first time I officially wore makeup in my life, wow, I can't believe it, I'll look so good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient with makeup, and the makeup is natural.
The location was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and I didn't feel very cold. When we took pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and helped us sort it out right away if it was a little bad.
The photographer was also very humorous, and I felt very happy taking pictures all day.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn't want guests to delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, it didn't mean that we added photos at all. None of the 24 photos in the direct package were added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000 package. At the time, I was stunned, and I was afraid I would choose too many)
Today's photo was fixed. Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two of them that I didn't think were very good, and they immediately helped me fix them again.
Comparing the photos my sister took before, I think I'm really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I really recommend everyone to take wedding photos with Mrs. Hsuan Han Jin!
Package price: 3,999 yuan
Mrs. Kim is grateful to have you, and I sincerely wish you happiness and a promising future!

Sabah 3,200 newborns without newspaper paper Internet anti-counterfeiting paper out of stock
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that since the stock of specially made anti-counterfeiting paper was exhausted, it has not been possible to issue newborns since the beginning of October. The cumulative number of people affected has reached 3,200 people.
However, the director of the bureau, Kailu Aminus, assured that the information of all babies who have applied for the newspaper has been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained in response to an online media report that Sabah's newspaper printing problem had occurred for 10 months.
He said that the related issues had arisen 2 months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers that produce specially made anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, which delayed delivery to our country. ”
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah newspaper paper is different from other regions, so it is not possible to trade stocks belonging to other states.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month. Later, it was handed over to a printing company on the 8th to carry out some printing work.
“The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in 2 working days (December 20). ”

Super convenient. Just like turning on the computer, it solved the problem that my computer had insufficient hard drive
The brand-new SSD that just arrived today cannot be read by a mobile SSD computer. The mobile SSD computer does not recognize it, and the computer that uses a USB flash drive can read it.
The machine is very light to use, and the appearance is atmospheric and beautiful.
I used it one afternoon today, the heat dissipation was very good, I basically didn't feel hot, the speed was fast, and the boot spike killed 99% of users.
The battery is also very strong. After 9 hours of standby, there should be no problem using it for 4 hours. In short, I feel very happy to be able to buy a machine of this quality at this price. Other functions will be discovered and added later.
It looks great.
In terms of performance, we will evaluate it after using it for a while.
The machine is faster, bigger than imagined. Render renderings with levers, like it, wait a while before reviewing
Nice, I found the serial number of the machine in Hong Kong**, and the quality should be OK.
**It doesn't feel big, it's heavy, it's actually not big if you can't hold it with one hand. It's a little bigger than 15.6 inches and it's really stable, and I don't feel stuttering. I love the sound of the fan cooling, it feels great, and it doesn't keep spinning like a game book
Nice stuff. It's much cheaper than the official flagship store, and I also sent a backpack, which I think is very good.
The store service was also good, reminding me to update the BIOS and open it in time**.
It's worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: Very good heat dissipation, basically no heat, Lightness: Easy to carry Appearance Material: Thinkpad traditional design, satisfied
Reputable seller, carefully check the appearance of the whole machine, all interfaces, no signs of refurbishment or use. It is indeed a brand new US version of the machine, and the configuration is the same as the page.
I forgot to send a backpack and immediately reissued a backpack for me. Although it is not the standard original backpack, the service follow-up is enough to prove that it is a conscientious seller.
If you have a friend who needs to buy a laptop, buy it back.
Appearance material: appearance atmospheric display effect: screen resolution is OK, clear, light and thin: it is more textured, after all, the heavier the thing, the better it feels.
Heat dissipation effect: I tried it at the beginning, and will evaluate it later.
The keyboard is very good to type. I also sent a mouse and a converter. This configuration is still very affordable compared to the Bank of China. Overall, the goods are cheap and beautiful. If the machine's performance is used for a while, I will evaluate it after using it for a while.
This screen is really comfortable!
It's very smooth to use, and I'll review it again for a while!
Education Information: Beijing compresses the proportion of special students enrolled in junior high school in 2016-Xinhua
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination work for special students enrolled in junior high schools in Beijing was uniformly organized and implemented by the education committees of each district.
This year, all districts of Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio of special students, and competition for special students is even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the overall enrollment ratio of special students from primary schools to junior high schools in the district this year did not exceed 5% of the number of enrollment plans in the district. The planned number of students enrolled was 380, and the school attendance ratio did not exceed 10% of the number of school enrollment plans.
All students with expertise in sports, arts, and science and technology who register online are eligible to participate in the special student enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to participate in examinations nearby, Dongcheng District continued the examination arrangement method last year. Each school district has set up 1 to 2 examination locations, with a total of 13 examination locations.
All test sites are divided into examination rooms according to examination areas, and time periods are divided in hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the test site according to the time period to conduct examinations in examination rooms in different examination areas.
On May 23, the District Education Enrollment Examination Center announced the list of students who passed the examination online. Students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
Didn't receive food
The point is that I didn't eat tonight
If you can't deliver it, you can say it sooner
Chairman of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina: I firmly believe in China's ability to host the Winter Olympics well during a special period-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 11 from Sarajevo - Bosnian Olympic Committee Chairman Kvesic recently said that Poland is very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics well during a special period.
Recently, Ji Ping, Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, met with Bosnian Olympic Committee President Kvesic at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvesic positively evaluated Bosnia-China relations and said that he visited China on the occasion of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. He was extremely impressed by China's excellent organizational work and firmly believed in China's ability to host the Winter Olympics during a special period. Poland is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnian Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation in the conference.
Ji Ping said that China and Poland have a special “Olympic bond”.

Negative nucleic acid for 48 hours, set up a “buffer zone” The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling for strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 11 from Beijing (by staff reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) - The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to have a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when each province, region and city determines the port city scope and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities that are in a position to do so can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control in their jurisdictions.
Relevant officials from the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission explained that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the region, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of a zoning differentiated management policy, changing from one line of defense for spillover prevention and control to two lines of defense, is expected to move the gate forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks in China, all imported from abroad through port cities.
The above notice points out that this revealed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate killing of cold chain items in all aspects, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of shortcomings in prevention and control in port cities, do a good job of prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and tighten the foreign defense import defense line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should simultaneously study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and livelihood security work, publish and unblock livelihood security hotlines, regularly investigate emerging hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, etc., and promptly resolve and proactively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in it include the county (city, district, flag), city (prefecture, state, league) and municipality directly under the Central Government where open land, waterway and air ports are located. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region or municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Orphan.
Vintage items inevitably have minor flaws, so if you decide to buy vintage products, you have to be prepared for this. If you are a perfectionist, I will explain the obvious flaws. This is a characteristic of vintage products, and I personally think good things don't care about that little influence!
We do not accept returns or exchanges for vintage products in the store.
So-called vintage, vintage, and designs will all have a retro feel of the times, that is, nostalgia. The reason I like vintage is that I also like its sense of time and its texture!
So for some girls who can't handle it, don't say their clothes are old-fashioned, they can only say you're not suitable!
Buy with caution if you don't have the slightest risk resistance. Online shopping is risky, so you need to be careful when shopping.
If the item is not suitable or disliked by the buyer himself, etc., you can ask the store owner to put it on the shelf for transfer. Once it is sold, it is not refundable or exchanged, do not shoot what you can't do. Thank you all for your cooperation!
Sold in some circles on 2021.6.11.

The truth about the bloodthirsty killing of the US military in 20 years-Xinhua
(Video source: Tubing)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called “Killing Machine” on the tubing platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan under the name of “anti-terrorism”, forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war. In 20 years, it committed various crimes against humanity by using military force, bloodthirst, and indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Misuse of drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distort humanity, and set up murder teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a “black prison” to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the “suspects”.
A crime against humanity stirs up the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style “anti-terrorism” war “becomes more anti-terrorist”.
The war brought no hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people; it brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poking at the video, let's debunk the truth about America's bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism”, and poke through the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I accidentally saw something like the following article. From a commercial point of view and from the perspective of the shelf life, why this customer wants a logistics company in the free trade zone to help with canning. Although canning is deep processing, it is not within the scope of the bonded logistics company's business. The following text here may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the ingredients in the bag are exactly the same as the milk powder in the bag, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of a bag one year, while a hearing bag has a shelf life of two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating it out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the dress is not the same!
Now let me tell you the reason why it's expensive to listen to it. Where is it expensive?
Why is there such a big difference in price when they have the same raw materials?
Because when pricing, most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have had a big increase in the pricing of listening outfits to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening packs rather than bags.
Also, you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising fees every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine, everyone knows.
Well, with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, for example: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display fees, product giveaways, advertising costs, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and they are listening, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that has come out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their own products, use no means to link up with doctors in hospitals. They assist in the promotion of their products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from the first hearing.
However, the relevant laws of China absolutely do not allow such methods and methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy milk powder in bags and put them in cans on the premise that you have a can at home, so you can save money, and increase the storage and tightness of milk powder, and have no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of a hearing bag is longer than that of a bag. If the shelf life of a hearing bag is the same as that of a bag after opening the package, it's just that the bag is not easy to store after opening the bag, and it is easy to deteriorate from moisture.
The food was delivered late, the food was cool, and after it was cool, it was dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it at all

Don't scare people off at the starting line-Xinhua
When I visit the book market, I often feel the popularity of books on successful studies.
Many of today's success studies books promote the “best principle” — that is, assume or imply that you can “do it” first, and then tell “what” you need to do.
It's tantamount to saying that all of a sudden we have crossed the “how to do it”, which is actually the most important and fundamental link.
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic — either you work hard to your best, or you just don't do anything; it's 100, or it's 0; or you climb Mount Taishan, or you just stay where you are.
This kind of “best principle” makes anyone who sees it admit to being “extremely correct”, but 99% of people will be intimidated by the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of “you have to make up your mind, become a human again, and make a big 180-degree transformation”, and this is precisely the Achilles heel of many people.
For people who stick to the rules, follow the old, and refuse to change, you prefer to shout “You want to change” in his ear, which is undoubtedly an act of deceiving oneself and playing piano against cattle.
The vast majority of people are timid in the face of the word “transformation”, and it is difficult to make up their minds; or they decide to “change” with a momentary impulse and pain, and bravely take the first step, but often the good picture is not long, and they lose the battle without persisting for a while, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic “Starting Tomorrow” is the most evocative expression of this classic of “universal humanity”.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of the abilities of ordinary people, causing the vast majority of people to “look at the door and sigh.”
Perhaps the “second best principle” is a way that is likely to allow more ordinary people to embark on a path of relative success.
The core of the “second best principle” is “lowering the threshold” — it encourages the theory of “winning small wins big wins”, that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is never greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Taishan, you can just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that's always better than stepping where you are.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not doing it.
Since the threshold has been drastically lowered, it is more likely that ordinary people will persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the path to success following the “second best principle” is a bit longer.
All in all, the “best principle”, although ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, is actually a minority that it can ultimately inspire; and the “second best principle” can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year.-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the bare carp resource reserves of Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year over the previous year to 108,500 tons. Compared with the beginning of protection in 2002, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake bare carp, commonly known as “mackerel”, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, the number of bare carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to factors such as mass manslaughter and the deteriorating environment in the breeding waters of bare carp. In 2002, the bare carp resource reserves in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, naked carp from Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the “Red List of Chinese Species”.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has imposed a closure on the lake to raise fish. It prohibits any unit, group or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the Lake District, and prohibits the sale of bare carp and its products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through measures such as artificial breeding and discharging, cleaning up the main rivers entering the lake in Qinghai Lake, and scientifically and reasonably designed “fish crossing channels”. The reserves of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, explained that up to now, nearly 180 million tails of bare carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially bred and discharged, contributing more than 23 percent to the recovery of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source area of the three rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued anti-fishing notices in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and has established a “one river, one river, one lake” comprehensive ban management system.

I just saw an article about an official holiday, which is too long.
Give science popularization to men you don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first official holiday on one day between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, I will do it more regularly once a month.
However, it is not regular enough to accurately predict. Tolerances of about a week need to be prepared in advance, and sometimes poor luck rolls over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some have little flow, some have severe blood loss; some have little reaction, some have pain to be taken away by an ambulance. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. No pain before meant no pain for the rest of your life.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding for 24 hours in a few days from the beginning to the end. The only thing you can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent blood from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. Eating ibuprofen quickly when dysmenorrhea has not had time at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat it after dysmenorrhea begins.
It is easy to have diarrhea before menstruation due to uterine hyperemia and excessive prostaglandin release.
If I'm about to reach my cycle, I have diarrhea inexplicably, and basically menstruation will come within 2 days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins once every two or three hours. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 tablets. If you add the portion prepared in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Revise here. You don't need to change tampons often. You can change them once in about five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormonal activity during menstruation may be irritable, and during ovulation, emotional instability due to hormonal changes in the body is also very unlucky, and the body stumbles on itself.
However, official crime rate data show that women are still very capable of controlling their emotions, and there is no excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shedding endometrium.
The endometrium is the thinnest after menstruation ends, and then it slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month a house is built (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. The guests don't come, all of them are removed (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and the weeks go on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, I bleed 24 hours a day every month, and I also had abdominal pain and back pain. Who would like it?
But a man can be born because his mother came to menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone wants to thank their mother for having menstruation regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is nauseous, feels that the preparation of a woman's body to nurture her life is disgusting, shouldn't be said in the public, girls stand up, don't think this way anymore, have never experienced it in this life, and don't know much about men, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful at any rate, how embarrassed is this attitude to face their own mothers, how embarrassed are they to want their own children?
Finally, let's try tampons, sisters, it's really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice holiday, so it's disappointing to send it wrong

Is foot soaking in the foot bathtub leaking electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in pedicure health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's awareness of health care increases, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers. A large number of products of different grades have also emerged in the market. Foot bathtubs ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan are diverse, giving consumers a lot of room to choose from.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling hot, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
“Soaking your feet in live water is really dangerous!”
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday present for his father, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in the soles of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bathtub. He didn't expect the vibration function to be turned off. His father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
As soon as Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, the pencil actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bathtub was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant. The attitude of the merchant was quite good. Despite quitting the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that this foot bathtub, which has been popular for a long time, now does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the maximum temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, in general, foot bathtubs will not have a live problem, but it is not ruled out that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath at the time of purchase.
Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety hazards.

Hunan Daily, December 10 (All Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan Correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the sprint to the 100 billion tea industry target.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand recommendation at the opening ceremony that the source of Huhong is new, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into “colorful Hunan tea”.
In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of “Sanxiang, Four Water and Colorful Tea”.
The tea industry in the province has stepped up innovation. Major teas such as green tea, black tea, and black tea have taken turns. The main tea production areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving the vast majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
Feng Shui takes turns, and black tea is gaining strength again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea, black tea and black tea, tea farmers have an income all year round, and the output value of tea plantations has skyrocketed.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the “Hunan Black Tea” trademark. Xinhua praised the “Source of Huhong”.
At the Xinhua Black Tea Pavilion, a Fujian tea merchant fancied an alpine tea called “Bingli Spring” and immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that factors such as the current epidemic have affected the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but judging from the tea fair scene, there are many highlights.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and popular, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if these foods aren't hot, can they be canceled?

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are the basic laws of philosophy that aim to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation “metaphysics” is taken from the phrase “The Metaphysics Are the Way the Metaphysics Are Said, the Metaphysics Are the Instruments” in “I Ching • The Phrase Uploaded”. It was translated by metaphysics for Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period).
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is to “study exactly which nouns represent real existential entities, and which nouns only represent a concept”.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation is that all phenomena can be explained with the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of research that does not say God
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the physical body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss “the relationship between mind and body.”
The theory of intellectualism is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic reflection and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct endorsed by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various moral views, and suggesting ethical guidelines for correct or wrong behavior.
It studies what type of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (disciplines that apply ethical theories to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collects information about how people live, and summarizes them from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but rather investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents (moral agents), which contributed to all the moral factors of this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: Ethical ideas of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
Part II: Ethical ideas of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part 3: Ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, representative figures: Hume et al., 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representative figures: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire et al., 18-19 century, German academy ethics, Representative figures: Kant and Hegel et al., 18-19 century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sickiewick, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, German neo-Kandist ethics, representative figure: Li Kaier, etc., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figure: Toledo Mas Hill Green et al.), transition Period ethics (irrational ethics, representative characters: Kirkay Guo Er, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a discipline that studies “principles and standards for effective inference and proof”.
Logic generally consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retroactive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline whose theme is the study of the essence of beauty and its meaning.

Sheep Xingyi (chè), whose real name is Jiang Bo, was born in the Year of the Goat in the Year of the Goat. It is suitable for sheep walking grass. It is a good place to go for sheep, known as “Uncle Sheep”.
He is known in the industry as a “suspense geek” for publishing works such as “Anecdotes of Thailand”, “Anecdotes of India”, “Anecdotes of Japan” and “Anecdotes of Korea” in the “Exotic Code” series, and claims to be “good at serious nonsense in a book”
“Black Under the Light”, also known as “Anecdotes of China”, “Suspense Geek” Yang Xingyi takes you to an in-depth look at the bone marrow of Chinese folklore with his new work “Black Under the Light”. What kind of poignant and moving love-hate songs are behind those legends that have been circulated to this day?
“Stray Walkers” Nan Xiaolou and Yue Wuhua once again embark on an expedition to death, and their lives are about to be revealed.
“Suspense Geek” Sheep Xingyi lost her hair and accumulated millions of best-selling books to dedicate!
The genuine “Anecdotes of China”, a brand new work after “Exotic Code”, with the same author and the same protagonist, continues the unfinished story of “Anecdotes of Thailand” and “Anecdotes of India”!

Ding Zilin: To a friend.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued a humanitarian appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted until now.
Nowadays, the elderly parents of the vast majority of the victims have died, and the orphans have also grown up to start families and work.
It was your act of righteousness that helped our families in distress get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most donors have also retired their annual retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of the Tiananmen Square Mother Group, which belongs to us. This humanitarian relief campaign should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love, and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will surely be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the National Federation of American Self-Defense (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the National Federation of Aesthetics and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy are two parallel organizations, and project implementers often cross.

Bailouts are often not delivered smoothly in the hands of June 4th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special team was set up by the “Tiananmen Square Mother” to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “64 Orphan Education Fund”. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all 64 orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the “64 Special Hardship Household Relief Fund for the Lonely Elderly”, which has been implemented to this day.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in June 4th, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the 64 victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong raised in the name of 64 that year.
During this period, “Human Rights in China” is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding's suspension of the June 4th donation was due to the donor's consideration. We are indeed all retired elderly people, and their income is not as good as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his “To a Friend” letter.
We will respect the decision of those in distress, terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have persisted in giving generously over the years and risked delivering humanitarian aid funds.

Thank you rabbit for the comment originally said that rejecting antiquity is not suitable for antiquity. I didn't expect the finished product to come out, it was simply beautiful
Thanks to Dandan's recognition, your satisfaction will allow us to continue moving forward with a full charge, and we will continue to cheer up!
This photo studio is amazing and I highly recommend it to all my friends!
Everything from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production is impeccable.
Makeup artists are very delicate and will match makeup that suits you according to your style, and cosmetics are all big brands on the front line.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite a major.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and two kittens play with them.
We work in Beijing. All the better studios in Beijing need to line up half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues filmed in Beijing, and after watching the film, I felt it was just so so.
I was looking for this studio, a place with a soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor. I think this is also a short version of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-designer, an excellent team.
When it came out into a film, we and the people around us praised it.
I've already recommended my girlfriend in the past, and my girlfriend is just as happy to watch the negative film.
I hope studios like this won't be buried. More people will discover TA and shoot their own style, not one-size-fits-all.
Thank you very much to Zhan Ying and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it 100%. Thank you for meeting each other.
Sweet and caring assistants, and lively and cheerful photographers and teachers, everyone on the team was super nice and wonderful. It was an unforgettable experience, and the results were better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘
Thank you, Xiao Yu for your comments, it's also a fate to know you, and the trust you have placed in us from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao is thousands of kilometers away. I'm very happy to know you guys and have a chance to come back to Qinhuangdao next time
How do I get the money?
The redelivered meal has already been delivered

Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A little bit of programming that I want to share my personal experience with.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have an idea about this, it's best to study yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for people with weak self-control, and training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it depends on the faculty strength of this institution. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, check out this training institution before choosing it. It is best to check out the students who come out of this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know exactly what the institution is like, and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question when you ask this question, because I haven't given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one study cost is high, and the second is a lot of time invested, and it basically takes 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if I were talking about these situations, it would be very convenient to self-study. Nowadays, many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are also many training resources when you go to Station B. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultations.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be studied comprehensively with videos.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study. This way, the study is not very strenuous. The teacher explains it in detail, and there are also people who specifically answer any questions, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and recommend going to the company after studying. In this way, the interview session for finding a job later can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions. As I mentioned earlier, because I don't know about your situation, the introduction is not detailed. If you have anything else you want to consult, you can feel free to contact me for communication.
I said it was before 1 o'clock, and I saw it all in the app
What is it
I haven't finished talking about it yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted stove water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional sewing, housekeeping
Thank you to those who silently give me praise. I work hard for life, life is tiring but I have to continue
Life will not live up to everyone's efforts. Pay attention to me if you like it. Thank you to those who silently praise me
Life is like this. Others only look at the results, support the process on their own. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong, just continue. We can look back on the road, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home. Seeing the satisfied smile and thumbs up of the customer, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort will pay off!
My day-to-day job
——Your request, my service.
Careful service, careful cleaning, and good retention.
For the details you care about, Feng Gui Housekeeping has helped you to be “clean” as much as I can, and serve my family.
Keep Wan's family clean, build a reputation for housekeeping, service in place, and clean home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily job
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dull and dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. It can only shine brightly after cleaning, and the same is true of life
If you do it with your heart, you can succeed. Using meticulousness to shape exquisite, beautiful sewing is serious.
Give me a chance and I will definitely satisfy you. The quality says everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
Right now, all walks of life are not doing well!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persevere enough, and work hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining”!
The plan for the day is in the morning. All the beauty starts early in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and wishful intentions, and keep a good mood all day long Good morning
When I was a kid, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I achieved it; when I matured, I discovered that happiness turned out to be a mentality, and happiness was understood.
Be the truest and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; one path in life, follow your own path; two treasures in life: good health, good mood, beautiful and bright until old age!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different challenges.
Many times, it's not your ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it frankly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Riyadh (by staff reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) - Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District located in northwestern Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. Tian Feiyu, Director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, is the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is “Crossing the River by Touching Stones”, which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the socio-economic transformation period, and also reflects the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
Covering an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and presented in six units: “Crossing the River by Touching Stones”, “Inheritance as an Experiment”, “Thinking on the Edge”, “Towards the Public”, “A Beautiful New World” and “On the Spirit of Art”.
Among them, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, including paintings, installations and performing arts. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, with some using recycled materials in novel ways. For example, Xu Bing recreated a classic landscape with waste in “The Story Behind the Scenes Series: Endless Views of Xishan” (2014) painting.
Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this Biennale will establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
“The goal of the Biennale is twofold. It not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art,” said Tien Feiyu. ”
According to information, a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening week. Artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Standardizing the Management of Rural Public Welfare Jobs-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Kunming (by staff reporter Lin Bifeng) - In order to continue to do a good job of providing employment assistance to the people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced policies related to promoting rural revitalization and the management of rural public welfare jobs to help promote rural revitalization comprehensively.
Relevant officials from the Yunnan Provincial Department of People's Social Affairs explained that at present, 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan to place employment for disadvantaged rural groups such as pro-poor laborers. They play an important role in helping people out of poverty to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation attacks, and effectively enhance the capacity of various rural public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, and Finance. It mainly uniformly regulates the target scope, fund management, job development, and job management of personnel recruited at the grassroots level for rural public welfare jobs.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations clearly establish them in accordance with the principles of “setting up posts as needed, identifying people by post, dynamic management, total control”, “who develops, who uses, who is responsible” and “one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management”.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare jobs. It stipulates that all rural public welfare job development departments should purchase commercial accident insurance for rural public welfare job placers; and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare jobs.

Hello
Can I cancel my order

2. Although the right wing has a successful era in history, it is not long, so it is short because if you give it some sunshine, you sweat when you drink some boiling water; if you get a little bit of ambition, you will have to look forward to Shu, and if you are hit, you will be attached.
However, seeking truth from facts, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution in defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As far as I'm concerned, even though I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I really care about what he says and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I think the anti-necessity revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, political groups, ichthyosaurs mixed with sediment, and foreign countries taking advantage of it.
4. Changing or improving China requires patience and an attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to get the chestnuts out of the fire with political speculation are not right-wing, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left again.
The left is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will still listen to some of the remarks made by the right and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this creation, because what the left wants is the bad food thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting Zuo Yi while fighting anti-thieves, and it was quite infuriating. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with traitors or Zuo Mann. They are all children's tendons, and it's unreasonable to say.
Don't try to prove that we're right either, let alone get the anti-thief and Zuo Mann to admit it. Why should it be?
I told my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you Wumao, and when Zuo scolds you for being your right dog, it just proves that our middle path is right!
Many people also had ideals when they were teenagers, but when they got old, they forgot their ideals or pursued them, but became paranoid.
It's getting farther away from ideals, and even dragon slayer teenagers eventually become evil dragons.
Left and right, I think it generally means restraint and freedom. China as a whole should be leftist due to the innate genes of history and culture.
On the other hand, the domestic right is free and focuses on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision, and pays more attention to fairness and security.
At present, society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the dispute between China and the US is certain to be on the left. It is estimated that it will continue for many
Even if you can't read it, you're done with a like
I'm not saying anything. Flowers and flowers are so righteous
In the past two years, the US emperor's blockade and blockade of Huawei chips has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused “American” companies to suffer huge losses.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and demanded that its own companies and allied companies block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing disruptions in the global chip supply chain shortage.
Today, “lack of core” has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies discontinuing production and rising mobile phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly from it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of “chips”, technology giants in more and more countries are beginning to move on the path of “de-beautification”.
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and the United States have recently made frequent moves to host the “chip summit”. They also invited 64 giants to set up a semiconductor alliance and raised funds to support local US technology giants. For example, Intel, an established US imperial technology giant, spent US$20 billion to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona in the United States to regain its dominance in the chip field. And open chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely that it will steal TSMC's “job bowl”.
The reason for this affirmation is that Intel, as an established technology giant in the US Empire, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserves, and will surely be able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel's decision.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made an amazing statement. Regarding Intel's move to spend money to build a fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly that Intel built a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies of the last century, Intel has always been a jewel in the US imperial manufacturing industry. It is the world's top position and the world's hegemon in the semiconductor field.
Until the 80s of the last century, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. From chip design, manufacturing to sealing and testing, it was done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged by the huge cost of building production lines.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 80s, the chip industry began to experience a division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were specialized designs, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC emerged.
TSMC targets its main business as a single link in “wafer processing”. It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at the time, was a small minion in front of Intel, the Big Mac.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou sought investment from Intel. However, as soon as Intel heard that TSMC was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, apparently some regarded themselves very highly. They looked down on TSMC and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer processing services at the time.
I didn't expect giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then, but now they also have to start foundry wafers.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thought it was ironic that Intel entered foundry for wafers.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still and proclaim itself.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm 7 years ago.
It's actually not easy to catch up.
No wait
It's been 2 hours since the order was placed at 19:06 😅
Let's take a look at some “Strange Hot Searches” today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three popular searches were randomly selected: the rise of Erlong in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the goods rally incident. The spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smoothing curve) eventually dissipated. If secondary public opinion was generated, a small hump would reappear.
They look no different from the “Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model” once displayed on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six popular searches from the same event were randomly selected, showing [solitary peak], [jagged], and [cliff shape].
[Solitary peak] is artificial heating, which quickly hit the hot list and attracted public attention; [jagged] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is on the hot list; [cliff-shaped] is collective evacuation. The hot search has completed its “function”, received new tasks, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one incident happened to be the valley of another incident. The time was not bad in minutes and seconds. It must have been a unified approval of the Navy to receive the task and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popularization, which lead to momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which misleading judgments, which incite emotions, which contain decisions, black property accounts in batches and nodes are refined to fight, taking into account almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Leaving aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have no place to hide.
Everyone who walks by must leave traces. We will dig up traces like this together.

Cases of Omiquelon strain infection detected for the first time in Mauritius and other countries-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Beijing - Comprehensive reports from Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time cases of infection with the novel coronavirus mutated virus Omikron strain.
Mauritius first reported two cases of infection with the Omiquelon strain in the country on the 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist departing from South Africa and arriving in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected was a native Mauritian resident. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, both infected people tested negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus's Ministry of Health announced on the 10th the country's first confirmed cases of infection with the Omikron strain.
All three were students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital for treatment because they were all mild illnesses.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik Jong strain, the Serbian government has continuously stepped up its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and over entering the country by air will be required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense after arriving in the country.
Serbia's Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country detected three cases of Omikejon strain infection for the first time.
The country's health department genomic sequenced 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and discovered these 3 cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at my budget of 70,000 for a basic renovation at first.
When I came to the store, I started a series of tricks.
The first time I arrived at the store, I only showed them my apartment map. They didn't go to the site to measure the house. They could actually quote me that 70,000 of my 135 house could be done. I probably showed me their materials and I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that you will drag you to pay the deposit as soon as you arrive at the store (and once this money is paid, you will never be able to withdraw it, unless you have enough experience to fight a theoretical battle with them).
When I'm hesitant about paying a deposit, they invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being deceived. When my mind is impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
There were a lot of questions about the offer he gave me 70,000, which did not include water and electricity transformations, did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three were the bulk of the cost of the base installation.
In addition to these, their point of service fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign a contract without making anything clear at the beginning.
When I went to them to refund my money, they showed a very experienced appearance, and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.
It's the customer's problem to bite them to death in one bite anyway, and they're completely irresponsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and there are many details. If you don't want to say them one by one, it's all tears. Anyway, don't choose them, because the house my friend looked for them to renovate was also of poor quality, and I'll calculate various expenses for you later.
Fool me, they were originally deceptive faucet decorations, but now they have been changed to great beauty, as if they went out of business again and changed to something else.
So don't you choose a foolish decoration company like this.
In the future, when you make a choice, take a look at these more than a hundred degrees and check these consultations because decoration is not a small amount

There's an appointment in the starry sky丨The Gemini meteor shower ushered in a big way on the
Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Tianjin (by staff reporter Zhou Runjian) - Astronomical science experts explained that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be extremely large on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night after that day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu filmed the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent object of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200 asteroid Faetong, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second meteor shower currently known not to be “bred” by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomical science expert, explained that just like Lunar New Year blockbusters, Gemini meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, and the “release schedule” can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high flow and stability. Together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is called the top three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A distinctive feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteor body is slow, colorful, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual and astronomy beginners to shoot.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing filmed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely large at around 15:00 on December 14. The maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the overhead under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart.
“Last year, people were deeply impressed by the 'colorful setting' Gemini meteor shower, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the degree of excitement will be slightly discounted.
The 14th is November 11 of the lunar calendar. The moon phase is a bulging moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with observations. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the middle of the night. At this time, the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours after the moon sets in the middle of the night, but be careful to keep warm from the cold. ”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not recommended to observe in a city. You can choose a place in the suburbs or countryside with a high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing the northeast, and then wait patiently until the moon sets to observe visually.
It should be noted that the Gemini meteor shower has a lot of flow in all directions, so you don't need to keep an eye on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing it.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster film', it's best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, battery backup, and shutter cables are also essential for stability and continuity. ”
Xiu Lipeng cautioned.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, what the title owner said about traditional televisions should refer to LCD televisions, while the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD televisions are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared to the fully expanded market positioning of LCD televisions, laser televisions obviously focus more on the large-screen market, or laser televisions themselves are products created for large screens.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches in size, while laser TVs are generally 75 inches or more in size, and the largest exceeds 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, laser TVs have been increasing in global shipments and sales, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, the laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and will continue to grow rapidly.
The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser televisions in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly hit the eyeball. Compared with the backlight emitting light of an LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the irritation to the eyes is less.
Ophthalmologists from the Saisi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through rigorous comparison tests of people watching laser TVs and LCD televisions under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser televisions do have strong eye protection properties and even have a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs focus more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, most of the laser TVs on the market are currently priced at more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light sources, prices are gradually rising.
Why are laser TVs so expensive to sell?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD televisions and projections.
With ultra-short focal projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. It requires little space, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition to lower heat generation, less loss to equipment, and a longer service life of the TV.
In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K UHD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audiovisual experience.
I can't talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation. When it comes to picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video players. If you want to balance the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. There are pros and cons to everything. You can judge for yourself after weighing it off, and I'm afraid to listen to the words on the side.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle near-focus projectors — laser televisions, have to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which is not optimal for optics.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive. The price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65 inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point that is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eye can see is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it either. If it's true, the LCD TV is also really “direct”. Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Also, if the projection screen wasn't a diffuse reflection, it wouldn't be an image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens is ignored, and a lot of light is reflected on the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenshu Visual Aesthetics Photo Studio Preferred Quality Store does not have a branch yet
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister sent me a selectable schedule, and the reply to the message was more timely ~
Before I went, I saw the filming in the store. It was more of an outdoor wedding dress. The shots were very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After the arrival of the day, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my little sister. I was very patient to help me try on two sets of clothes that I was tangled up with, and finally decided to start makeup style~ The photographer would put up some props before shooting, would guide the movement, and strive for excellence in various details.
But maybe because I didn't exchange specific shooting ideas with me, it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be nice 🙊🙊
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help select the photos and exchange the later styles, and I feel very careful about the horn.
It will take about half a month to fix the film, sit and wait for the effect~
I won the Overlord Meal event in the photo category for the second time - I was able to choose one piece of clothing for the whole audience.
Finally, I chose a black gauze dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours. Makeup+shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting was a younger brother after 95. I still felt a bit cynical. I hope I can give more advice on how to guide the customer's shooting movements in the future. It was very talkative, and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Wenshu Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Preferred Quality Store Reply
On the homepage, let's take a look at Queenie too~
Arrived at the store first fill in the name and phone and then choose clothing, wedding dress can be selected, changed three or four sets of clothing is quite patient, after choosing makeup for a long time, service attitude is good, the back shooting will teach you how to style, that is, the shot feels big, it will be half a month, three or four days will be sent, I feel like it's no different from the original film
[Environment] Overall OK.
Lots of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup locations, and inside is a studio.
[Service] Very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you how to move very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make up the shoot.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit too much. Originally, the double eyelids were affixed with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrow is also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for not thrush on a daily basis.
The photo was given for about ten days, but I'm not very satisfied with the P picture effect. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets, and picked them out or chose a black dress. My little sister said this set was more Hepburn retro
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up my hair. The hairstylist and the makeup artist's little sister were super patient and very satisfied with the results I got
Once I got my makeup done, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me all the way, and the posing process was very easy and harmonious
After filming, I carefully selected four of my favorite Dang Xiu Little Brother said the ending of the film within 15 was very satisfied~
No response in 3 days... Since your system doesn't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG # plus monthly plan!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can I waive my monthly fee until your investigation is complete, is that OK?
Is it reliable to buy insurance with a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
Judging from the conditions set: According to the “Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (2015 Revision)”, those who become insurance brokerage companies must meet three key words: shareholders and sponsors have no major illegal records in the last 3 years, a minimum amount of RMB 50 million can only be established, and the consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission must be obtained.
These three rules are actually very harsh. In summary, they need to be strong. They must be approved by the state authority of the Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks throughout the country), and shareholders must have a good style of work. As an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, policyholders don't have to question too much whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can meet.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the newly listed Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance. The claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance. Little Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
Judging from the payment model: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of employee wages, Internet products are generally cost-effective. Moreover, payment methods are flexible, support monthly payments, reduce the pressure on policyholders to pay fees, and at the same time maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
You can consider it.
From the point of view of salesman professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional industry, many Internet product customers can apply for insurance on their own, there will be many misunderstandings. In health notices and careers, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, feel that they are healthy or in line, so it is easy to have many hidden claims, and may be denied compensation risk.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at “Tencent Micro Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable. It is people who are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners on the Internet channel, and there are also many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan of insurance coverage for 6 million, buying insurance to send a mobile phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid weight and are light. They won't tell the policyholder that 1 yuan in the first month and the next month will need to be charged according to normal charges, ranging from tens to 200. Many customers don't know what they bought themselves with a charge of one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million dollars (pie fell out of the world).
The free mobile phone delivery is only sent by the special policy number section such as 6666 or 8888 at the end of the policy, and if the winning text message is sent, you do not redeem it yourself, and no one reminds you.
(This is another pit for policyholders.) Receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance free of charge is short-term. If you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial insurance. If you really get seriously ill, what can 60,000 do? It can't solve the problem, and later life will start streaking.
Currently, the state is also severely cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So if you look at it all together, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject owner carefully consider it comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers to cover offline products, and each saved 2000-3,000 yuan/year on premiums.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of enterprise management training experience, served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before applying for insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailor insurance products for customers, shop around for customers, try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers, after applying for insurance, do policy collation for customers, policy hosting, so that customers can rest assured that they are worry-free.
Grow with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answers will be helpful to the title owner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance application processes after clicking the application link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the application of Internet insurance does not have a very “sense of ritual”, and there may not even be a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract in any way.
This model is a bit like a “telemarketing” assembly line operation, but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, which is that follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us for many years to come?

In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but we want to put an end to this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, what you need to boycott first is this uncivilized style of work.
From the time you started sending Facebook plus friend requests, then posting ridiculous posts, to your attempts to post so-called my home location and father's name on social media, I have taken an attitude of not responding.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to unscrupulously discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as my appearance, figure, good nutrition, and whether I grow strawberries in my bed, if I want to insert them, etc., I... forget it.
How do you know that later I received comments from friends about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing content to your Facebook friend account.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't continue to be silent anymore.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you did not converge at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what status you are. In our society, both sexes need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue to make this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not a picture you made or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to get to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there would be a girl who would want someone else to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said OK, you wouldn't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics, or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is at ease with the hearts of the people.
I cut off some of my comments for everyone
No one can impersonate you if you post your own stickers
All I can say is that you are a public enemy of civilization
I'll laugh at my heart
Vietnam People's Daily - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Zheng attended the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum. The topics discussed revolved around the two major themes of digital technology enterprises and the digital transformation of countries, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Man-hung said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of COVID-19, the number and operating income of Vietnamese digital technology companies maintained a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Man-hung called on digital technology enterprises to assume responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms. Taking on the task of developing digital platforms in these countries is to assume the national mission.

Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and enterprises.
Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, that internal forces are the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces are important and breakthroughs.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to be driven by in-depth development and sustainable development, participating in COVID-19 prevention and control, economic recovery and development, coping with subsequent changes, overcoming the depletion of natural resources, and helping green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and customs, etc., and promote digital transformation in banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developing.
Premier Fan Mingzheng requested governments at all levels, organs and enterprises at all levels to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve systems for digital transformation, strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in the spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity and initiative.

Easyhome has a total of 11 floors, negative 2 to 9 floors. Negative 1 and 2 are parking places, and parking is free during the day!
The surrounding area is really unusual. There are very few hotel hardware stores, and the restaurants taste average.
This elevator was also very speechless. Just like the major illness, it was minus 2 to minus 1, tossing back and forth. I kept pressing the floor. I went down from the safe passage to the first floor, and it was also very speechless. It led directly to a furniture store. The furniture store was closed, and the safe passage couldn't go out!
Easyhome still needs to be upgraded, and there are many places that have not been developed.

The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency report of December 11 from Wuhan (by staff reporter Wang Xian) - Chongqing's Fuling Water Green Integrated Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second integrated water green service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the listing and operation of the Luzhou Water Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province on the 8th.
So far, the Water Green Comprehensive Service Area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Jiang Navigation Administration Bureau of the Minister of Transport, explained that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 water-green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They were recognized by the majority of crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River. The pollutant reception and shipping service capabilities of Yangtze River ships have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the Water Green Comprehensive Service Area is an important facility that provides a full range of production and living services for the vast number of ships and crew members, and helps the vast majority of crew members solve the problem of “urgent distress”.
The two integrated water green service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, integrating life services, production services and government services, with the theme of green environmental protection, ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services, will realize “one berthing, multiple services” for ships in the port, which will make the crew sailing in the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and convenient to live.
Three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China Rare visit to Guam 2022 -01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese Communist Party media Duowei reports: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to information from the Chinese think tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform”, on January 9, the satellite discovered the US military aircraft carrier “USS Carl Vinson” (USS Carl Vinson) near the Barabakh Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects the “Carl Vinson” to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time the aircraft carrier “Carl Vinson” has been deployed with an F-35C fighter and a CMV-22 “Osprey” carrier-based transport aircraft.
The US military aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the “Carl Vinson”, is the USS Abraham Lincoln (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The “Lincoln” also carried the F-35C carrier-mounted aircraft squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th fighter attack squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region is the USS Ronald Reagan (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuga, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also included the missile cruiser “Lake Champlain” and the missile destroyer “Stockdahl”.
Three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China A rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.

(Weibo @南海战略态势感知) In addition, according to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine “USS Nevada” (USS Nevada), carrying 20 Trident (Trident) ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The US three aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China during a rare visit to Guam. Analysts said that this sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China on a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshao Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam this time strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as “boomer submarines” (Boomer submarines).
The whereabouts of the 14 “thunder submarines” in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the “Thunder Submarine” “the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity”. This system also includes launch silo ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent meta plunge of 26% and the market capitalization evaporated $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”. Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its revenue comes mainly from advertising. Advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., are Meta's traffic channels regardless of their functional positioning.
Not only that, but Meta is also the largest “advertising network”. Many apps are external to Meta ads, and monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information anymore, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to obtain their own information. The normal reaction of most people is certainly not to allow it.
If Google takes another stab at it next, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies that do maritime business.
Meta has an office of about a few hundred people in Hong Kong, and there are also several major agents in mainland China.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta earned quite a bit of money from Byte in the previous two years.
Various agents in China are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically learned about it lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage where Chinese companies burn money on a large scale overseas is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platform, including TT, is out of the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just falling incomes, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at income, but more importantly depends on future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations weren't enough.
In order to tell the market a new story Zuckerberg told the “meta universe”.
The meta universe should indeed be one of the directions in the future, but the realization cycle of the meta universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook right now. It also earns 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars a year. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it doesn't have a good security moat.
Although several of his social software models are now relatively active and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook doesn't have much confidence, and disruption is a blink of an eye.
And the concept of engaging in the meta-universe, which is promising and out of reach, has no hope of success at all in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is the root reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company again and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice was wrong. It's a path of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.

Xinhua News Agency report of December 12 from Hanoi (Zhou Na and Teng Huaijin) On the morning of the 12th, all Chinese participating units participating in the “Peace and Rescue - 2021” joint health service exercise between the two armies of China and Vietnam returned safely to Guangxi, China, marking the successful completion of this seven-day exercise mission.
In this joint performance, the two armies of China and Vietnam closely followed the mission of the guard service to save the dead and help the wounded around the major issue of humanitarian medical rescue. In accordance with practical standards, the two armies completed courses such as joint guard command, joint on-site rescue, and mass casualty handling, etc., which effectively enhanced the guard support capabilities of the two armies.
The results of the exercise were recognized by the Chinese and Vietnamese armies.
Nguyen Hung Seung, director of the Vietnam Exercise Steering Committee, deputy director of the Vietnam People's Army General Administration of Logistics and Chief of Staff, said at the exercise closing ceremony that through this exercise, Vietnamese military doctors learned knowledge about exercise organization and professional activities from Chinese military doctors, and also met with Chinese medical care and support equipment.
The results of the exercise proved the professional capabilities of the military and medical forces of the two countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
