Is there a way to punish him?
Lest this happen again.
Or how long will it take for the restaurant to be ready? Can you help me ask?
Students sing the leading role in the annual meeting of Zhejiang University, and the research results make the human brain open - Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with breath, and accurately search for the source of haze Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with open brains were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life science, and humanities education. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your home physician.
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smartphone side, which is half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a breath, and this instrument can initially detect the health of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang said the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses a new material, graphene, which targets chemical elements, and its keen sense of smell allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: Doctor's High-Energy Eyes.
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students of the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas amid the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and excision of many diseases is not in place, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
For example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during the early examination of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later, Shen said.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates, which adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been tried in hospitals such as Shao Yifu Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: Save water and be cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device."
As long as we stand on the sink of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and is combined with the water.
Then we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which not only ensures the degree of washing, but also saves 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that feels very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important in addition to the driver's license!!
Popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a period of time in the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this period that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, four golden minutes!!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there motionless and unable to do anything, the feeling of helplessness is so terrible.
"In China, our official figures show that three million people die accidentally every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70% and 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1% can be saved.
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person has cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, there is no effect in your pinching.
It is necessary to do artificial respiration and chest compressions to save people.
I find that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it is too late, so I call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!!
The first aid card can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be completed before the age of 25. It was also a few months ago that the first aid card was added to the list of goals, but it was indeed completed!
Then I have to take the other certificates I want to take, and I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before, and it seems that I have to have a first aid certificate to take the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings!?
I haven't tried it.
How can #NAME# not be written clearly?
13 yuan for one?!
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the meal, this time I will eat a shrimp dumpling!?
Because it is clear that when I entered the code before, I saw that it was valid.
First of all, I personally think that The Four Seas is an all-round bad movie, in all senses.
But if you say that the film is not a bright spot, it is not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, which can make you sleep soundly in the cinema, and which can make you feel indignant after watching it. The Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really a talent.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a genre novel, indescribable, and full of loopholes like a windbreaker on little Margo.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First, briefly say some of the plots that I have difficulty understanding.
The man's main place of residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minibus.
The elderly people are sitting in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was gone.
How did the hostess get the business license when she opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small bastard of the island car party easily seal off a mountain road??
Then the truck delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feeling is too obvious.
Why would a small bastard who can't get credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why did the police not report to the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arrange to not find the hotel owner, sit outside the room and sleep for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot pervades the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, what is even worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all, just a hideous stitch up monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, and after more than 20 minutes, you guessed it might be an inspirational film, and when you saw it, you thought it might be a drama film that wanted to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you would not know what you saw, and then you would have a deep doubt about yourself.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should honestly tell the story of the feud between the young man who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waiter sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not appear something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role in a new motorcycle that has just been burned and can still sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand to see.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for the acting or the director's request.
I also wonder why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Such a movie is arranged in the Spring Festival stalls, is it to add to the audience?

Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Enrollment is Enterprise Prospective Employee - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status, and will be pre-registered as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after enrollment.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the procedures for enrollment of students in secondary vocational schools and employment in enterprises be standardized, and that the dual status of apprentices' secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign tripartite agreements, and for apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but not reached the age of 18, agreements must be signed by the apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, and protection of rights and interests of apprentices on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use modern apprenticeship systems to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is based on the training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the internship at the top post is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a teacher can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills needed for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, each with a total of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then implementing it, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 causes more mild symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
This includes older patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19 infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the new-crowned patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days.
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half the rate of severe illness in the previous wave, and the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of COVID-19 patients died recently, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications are that this is a mild disease."
He added: "It's still early, and we need to get the data later."
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading COVID-19 strain, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounts for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!!

Education Commentary: What is it to save abducted children?
If we are analogous to the famous public service advertisement saying "no sale, no killing," then in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction," mass prevention and control, and anti-abduction by the whole people, make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency information release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I felt very warm.
The new technology means not only the name "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also the proper use of information, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to retrieve abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words."
However, before the abduction and trafficking cases are solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
In the context of the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether all abductions and trafficking in children should be punished by death" and other controversial topics can be put aside for a while and discussed with caution, but the rescue of abducted children is not allowed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime site as soon as possible after they are successful.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps to solve the case and recover the child.
After all, "fighting trafficking" is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
To fight crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the meticulous law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting children and helping the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three was resting at the train station, and the parents were asleep and woke up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Taking turns to rest between parents, or placing the child under secure protection, is the minimum means to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police crackdown on the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the statutory starting point for the crime of abduction and trafficking of children is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the penalty may be death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is severe. Under the general trend of "lighter punishment," the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, it is not possible to rely only on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for abduction and trafficking is widespread, the abductors are interested in profit, and constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, so as to form a situation of "fighting law" with law enforcement, anti-abduction operations will inevitably fall into the mire of inefficiency.
Therefore, the elimination of backward concepts and the popularization of common legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crimes of abduction, trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit after mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matter.
There are three levels according to the acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The highest grade and highest quality olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and pleasant botanical aroma, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are fair, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or as "secondary oil."
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to blend flavor and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is a transparent pale golden yellow.
Refined Olive - Pomace Oil: Olive oil is extracted from oil residue by dissolution and refined.
If you have looked at the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olive fruit is just like the grapes used to make wine. Olive fruit from different regions and varieties of olive fruit will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olives:.
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olives, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be sporadically planted in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):.
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates include Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are far south latitudes.
Olive picking month:.
From March to June of each year, the olive tree blossoms and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:.
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
The democracy summit ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Guanchong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how difficult the work ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet challenges, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the small fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day,".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Koon-chung addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China, including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.
Law also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values."
And that's why we failed.
This is why we have to change., "
During the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values," Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released the "National Statement" via video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without sealing the city, and we can defeat false information without taking it off the shelves."
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was scheduled, the US Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, and impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid I can't hold on to it, so I want to find a practitioner at a similar price first.
In fact, the price is often proportional to the friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball cannot withstand, and the master is very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn it, and I know you don't want to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, and if you play it twice, you won't play it again, so the beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress, and then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a better used racket, choose Prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket will not sell at a price, new rackets 500, 600 is very good, used 200 yuan, the enjoyment of a thousand yuan racket is not fragrant?
It is very friendly to the novice, but after the novice stage, it is very difficult, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times.
Can you help me to follow up?
Postponed.
Thank you.
That is to say, I already have credit?!
Do I need to place a new order next? Is the original order ignored?
Hello, I ordered the food from this restaurant, but the food delivered is missing a lot, and the saliva chicken is also raw.

In fact, there is a lot of emphasis on dressing and matching for girls who are slightly fat.
The skirt worn by a fat girl should not be too short or too long, and the length is almost at the knee, just enough to cover the fat part of the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, it will show the fat on the legs.
Too long will give a person the feeling of short and fat.
If you wear the upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you will naturally increase in height, that is, the upper body, skirt and stockings with different colors, it will look like a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark colors are standard for fat girls (which the author has a deep understanding of), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for fat girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially short black skirts, will make people think you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Lest people pay attention to your legs and feet, so that people get the feeling of obesity.
For girls who are slightly fat, we must tell you the tricks of how to dress and match.
Weak fat girls should never wear tight skirts, and the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people look uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind of thin plaid), choose a soft printed flared skirt, and match it with a top with a swinging collar, which can cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also fastidious in wearing short skirts.
When fat girls wear short skirts, they should choose a top that is the same color as the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat body.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN match in summer!
If you are MM with fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a short dress with a gorgeous feeling.
Not only can you cover your big belly, but you can also show your good points.
A short skirt will be very thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. The top should be tighter, so it will be more thin to form a sense of layering.
Simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Weak fat girls are also able to wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, the fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After a change in the way you dress and match, you should also exercise more in your life, and strive to get rid of the label of fat girls one day earlier.

The girl used as a target to raise money for her sister: "If you think of a skin injury, you will be fine," - Xinhuanet.
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a" target "to raise money for her sister" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than a person, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow to shoot after payment.
This behavior aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such a drastic move to raise money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the street "target" fundraising was warned.
In the picture posted on the Internet, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "a", with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink on the board, and her bank account number, WeChat account number, and Alipay account number written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after surfing the Internet.
Some netizens believed that this was an "eyeball begging behavior," and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls at the stall, both about 20 years old, and they were dressed young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play the game; another girl yelled at the side, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery, so please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, I could not think of a good way to raise money for the moment, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target and the other was responsible for the attack, but they did not participate in it. During the whole process, no one was found to shoot arrows, but someone looked around and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the security department, the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this kind of eyeball fundraising."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest year in 2021?!
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! Project Managers Can Impact Gold in Olympic Projects" which was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and fighting fires, taking the pot, and apologizing is not a problem.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the incompetence of the current project management work.
The people who are engaged in project management work also gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament in their work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management Twenty Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 PMP ® applicants nationwide, about 420,000 people passed PMP ® certification, and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past. The rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but when they really work on project management, they are still confused.
Many project managers often report the following problems: Project management knowledge is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and they do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to implement the project in the work, project estimates are not accurate, the control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again; the division of labor is not clear, the "old" in the team does not know how to deal with the poor communication between departments, and the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding enterprises to train a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles.
The online course "R&D Project Manager Training Camp" is an online fragmented learning method that combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
This course is not only conducted by a team of experts from Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, to provide an in-depth and professional explanation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform their learning content into concrete work after class.

Home Credit advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of the "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer - professional financial news website.

On the one hand, this consumption boom has made people lament the growing consumption power of the people, and on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents have performed better at the level of financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; the "Report on the Indebtedness of Chinese Young People" released by Nielsen and the "China Youth Consumption Report 2019 - 2020" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the overall trend of rational consumption is very different from the label of "excessive profligacy," some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption, and therefore, and they have excessive social risks, leading to the financial responsibility of enterprises.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption outlook, and actively responding to regulatory calls to take concrete actions to enhance consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.
Over the past many years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top universities in China, it has provided reasonable guidance to the consumption needs of young people, helped them to establish rational consumption concepts, plan their consumption needs rationally, and helped them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When spending, you must plan ahead and repay on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and continuously updated and iterative financial products to provide consumers with more appropriate and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and become a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner.

Vietnam People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move toward "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, with a view to addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that the Gulf Arab states have condemned for not being able to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that not resolving the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has held direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop that the nuclear talks between major powers and Iran have failed to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time propose measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf states.

Ok, ok.
It is said that the exhaust sound of super-running in the new mountain area is the loudest!!
This time our team brought you this car, which is the dream of many men!!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - the Aventador LP700-4!!
The price is nearly two million ringgit, the road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, and it is probably the myvi of Xiaobian that will reach 30km/h when people will reach 100km/h, huh.
The low body, the arrogant scissors doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass are the perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and Xiao Bian has put together some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
The 1km fuel money is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all).
The position of getting on and off the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will not climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half).
The engine is too loud, and when you get off the car, you will be deaf. (But it is still very cool)
The car is too big, it will be very narrow to park in a normal parking space, and I am afraid of being knocked when the car next door opens the door!!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiao Bian himself said, has nothing to do with the owner, haha).
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale, sorry!!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!!
For more information about cars you don't know, go to The Car Guide/People's Car Journal.
Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that all riders know that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron in just a few minutes!!
Look at the results, expensive is reasonable!!
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate in the same frequency - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits that have been accumulated over a long period of time in the process of development of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "good morality, good governance," and the patriotic responsibility of "developing a strong country."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the competition for education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying on a global scale. As an important "supply side," the higher education industry is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World First-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" demonstrates the confidence and determination of China to move from a major country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, and also puts forward higher and updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to be among the world's first-class in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still some gaps, so as to achieve "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, in order to gather strength, shape brand, and enhance the image; third, the advantages of the system, give full play to the advantages of socialist countries, strengthen the goal drive, gather consensus, and optimize the allocation of resources, so as to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catching up with the world advanced level.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with a thousand schools, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while making use of its advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, tradition of running schools and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to three characteristics in running the school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated and educational environment that integrates science and education, and combines schools and enterprises, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment of interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and iconic interdisciplinary achievements; third, highlight the characteristics of the school system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "seeking truth and innovation," the common values of "studying diligently, cultivating morality, discerning, and being truthful" and the common values of "Haina River, Enlightenment and Virtue, Enlightenment of the Former People, and the State of Our Nation" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the spirit of "using the talents of the world for our own use," and is expressed as the high-quality concept of learning from world-famous universities in running schools and educating people; "Enlightenment and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, universities should also be cultivated by virtue and cultivated by personality; "The people of the past" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both seeking innovation in knowledge and innovation in scientific research, as well as reform and development, and innovation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of operation.
"The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the unformed."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate their building into world-class universities.
At the same time, we will adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit, the spirit of the times and the national spirit interact with each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

President of Iran: Iran nuclear talks are expected to reach an agreement if sanctions on Iran are lifted - Xinhuanet

As the NFT rushed out of the loop, a new concept emerged in the cryptographic community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which combines various gameplay methods including NFT, and is the highest NFT project in terms of transaction volume, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily live users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, and with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, and can participate in the management of the game ecology in addition to the fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of the track, which refers to the choice of the target industry for investment. First, we should choose the industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan. Second, we should choose the industry with good growth in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth in the next 3-5 years.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which is to do things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing."
Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to land, in most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen the current field or extend the horizontal field (strategic thinking); on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can think about how to set the right activity KPI to achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling news; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, the first time that Bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improves the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduces the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admissions at three Ivy League schools, including Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter: Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States have filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to protest against discrimination against Asian applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to prestigious American schools has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asian Americans in the three prestigious American schools has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in the three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in admissions at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups participating in the complaint, there are also American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a housing agency. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, the family member of the owner of the house, on the details of the purchase of the factory building, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Sale and Purchase Deposit Receipt," which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the plant within a week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the method of payment, which led to the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
When the deposit was paid and the house was ready, the seller signed the contract on the spot, but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing the case, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed to be a failure of negotiation. Therefore, the penalty for the deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract for double return of the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer reminds] In the course of the transaction, we should exercise the necessary due diligence.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information, and to specify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out" democratic transformation, "abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated a" color revolution, "with disastrous consequences."
'Democracy 'has long been a' weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including Taiwan's leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own problems with democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt both internationally and in the United States, for example, criticizing some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who were invited to attend the summit. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is morbid, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party rivalry, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic conflicts, and the division between rich and poor becoming more and more serious," and that democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in every generation, and in my opinion, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign after the Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of us implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
OK, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the drinking method of red brand whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red brand whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and Red brand whisky has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of red brand whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it spoils its mellow flavor.
So how do you drink red whisky?!
Xiao Bian will give you a brief introduction.
Red brand whisky drinking method:.
Johnny Walker Red Brand Whisky is made from about 35 kinds of Scotch whiskies. It has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky. It has a rich aroma with sweet and smoky aromas.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and strong smoked malt flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red brand whisky has entered the country, and in order to adapt to the tastes of the people, red brand whisky + Coke or Sprite or Sinkis and other sparkling drinks have become a long-lasting fashion.
These sweet beverages, in addition to neutralizing the sour taste, can bring visual pleasure, and add beverages to dilute the taste and change the taste.
Red brand whisky + sliced lemon + sugar cube (also sugar) is the most authentic and traditional drink.
The authentic Red Fangwei taste is a bit sour and astringent, and adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, while lemon will bring a fresh aroma to the wine, and of course, the sweetness and acidity can be blended according to your taste preferences.
The above three are the best way to drink red brand whisky, you can try it as a reference, I hope the introduction of Xiaobian can help you.
Educational Thinking: How to Make "Learning Bully" and "Learning Slag" in College Examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the university leadership, reflecting their confusion about the university exam, and proposing to improve the difficulty of the exam and change the test question types so that the exam truly reflects the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a hot topic.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of learning, the learning situation varies widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the attack before the exam. If they think of other methods, they may achieve a multiplier effect with half the effort.
As a result, there is a "strange situation" in which "learning scum" can pass the test without investment and even get high marks, and "learning bully" never drops out of class, has good homework and notes, and the exams are not much higher.
From this point of view, it is not unreasonable for students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University to report problems in university exams, and I believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for exams by surprise, try to "get" test questions from teachers in various ways, and strive to delineate the scope of the exam, and get "key tutoring" before the exam. It is not even uncommon to have a small copy in the exam and ask the teacher to raise your hand after the exam.
In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guidance, the measure of a university's passing or not is more about the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific propositions based on it.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the subject and basic common sense. From the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the key."
However, the knowledge point is basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test questions are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually composed of question groups, and the examination papers are composed by the senior teachers of the subject, and the examination papers are also taken by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject, so that the repetition of the test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the actual teaching and learning situation, and the questions are easily distributed in a normal way according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and the type of questions, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability test, and at the same time, innovate the design of the question types.
Examinations are the baton of university education. What kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans for the exams, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University administration attaches great importance to the students' letter of recommendation, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination of the final exam of the course, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test paper propositions and examination links, refine the evaluation of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the course teaching.
To solve the problem of single type of test questions and repetitive questions from the mechanism is a problem that university exams need to face, and of course a corresponding system needs to be put in place, but kung fu is expensive in daily life, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, and to understand both sides of the test, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the actual situation, so that "learning bully" and "scum" will each have their own place.
If I can't change the location of the branch for me, can I change it to delivery?
So I don't have to give more money?!
Colleague's order has been delivered.
I can't finish it.

Golden Lady Wedding Photography (South Street) has no branch store yet.
Before taking the photo, we changed the time twice because we had not arranged the time, and the consultant Lan Lan patiently arranged the time for us.
Then I chose a weekend with good weather.
Mrs. King's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are excellent.
That was the first time in my life that I put on makeup officially. Wow, I can't believe that I will look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient in makeup, and makeup is very natural.
The exterior was filmed in Jiangwan City, but luckily the weather was very good that day, and I didn't feel very cold. When I took the photo, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and if it was a little bad, he immediately helped us to clean it up.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn't want to ask guests to delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, there was no idea that we should add photos at all, and none of the 24 photos in the direct package were added (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the 7,000-plus package, and I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many).
Today, the photos were repaired, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them and felt that they were not very good. They immediately helped me to repair them.
I compared the photos my sister took before, and I think I am really satisfied with our photos. Simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Mrs. Xuan Han Jin to take wedding photos!!
Set price: 3999 yuan.
Mrs. Kim is grateful to have you sincerely wish you happiness and a bright future!!
How much is this set?
What are the conditions for $32 to be used?
That's good. No refund.
Your rider said he couldn't find it.
I can't find it.
But I can't understand his English.

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah were cut off due to special anti-counterfeiting paper.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper was depleted, it has not been possible to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the total number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairu Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained a 10-month-long report by an online media that the printing of newspaper papers in Sabah had been a problem.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, which led to a delay in the delivery of the paper to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper is different from that used in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
According to Kailu Aminus, the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will inform the applicant to go to the local branch office to collect the birth paper.,"
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.
Wait until now from 7 o'clock.
Is that coming soon?!
I was referring to food.
I'm waiting on the opposite side of #PRS_ORG# again
Well, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready.

Education Information: Beijing Compresses the proportion of special students enrolled in junior high schools in 2016 - Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of special students enrolled in junior high schools in Beijing was organized and implemented by all district education committees.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio of specialty students, and the competition for specialty students has become more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the overall enrollment rate of primary and junior high school students in the district this year does not exceed 5% of the total enrollment plan of the district, with the planned enrollment of 380 students, and the school attendance rate does not exceed 10% of the school enrollment plan.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, setting up a "buffer zone" The State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a request to strengthen the prevention and control of epidemic diseases in port cities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who leave land border cities in the near future (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and to go to land border cities to have at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region or municipality determines the port city scope and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions could study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of a differentiated management policy in different regions, and the transformation of one line of prevention and control spillover into two lines of defense, is expected to move the threshold forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve maximum effectiveness in epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local concentrated epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice points out that this has exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, lack of implementation of closed-loop management for personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing being a mere formality, inadequate elimination of cold chain items in all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific precision in emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the shortcomings of port city prevention and control, to do a good job of prevention and control without relaxation and scientific precision, and to tighten the external defense input line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic and the protection of people's livelihood at the same time, publish and unblock the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly screen for emerging hidden dangers in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in the notice include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the Central Government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and the specific scope shall be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

The truth of 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the US military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: Tubing).
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, and committing various crimes against humanity in 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Indiscriminate use of drones to attack civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature and setting up killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to inflict various kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects."
A crime against humanity stirs up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the US-style "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorist, more afraid."
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth of bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!!
Inadvertently, I saw the following article, from the point of view of business and shelf life, why the customer wanted the logistics company in the bonded area to help do the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, there is no difference.
Then everyone will ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between cans and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mentality after eating reaction also said that the taste or taste of the cans is not the same!!
Now let me tell you first about the reason why the cans are expensive. Where is the expensive?
Why is the price difference so big that they have the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or no profits, so what do the manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of the cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
So with the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as the sales staff of shopping malls, the cost of display in shopping malls, the cost of product gifts, and the cost of advertising, are also increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is also constantly adding new products, and the price of the cans is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, use any means to link up with doctors in hospitals, who will assist in the promotion of their products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a single listen.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that you buy milk powder in bags and put it in cans on the premise that you have cans at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf life of cans is the same as that of bags after opening, it is just that the bags are not easy to store after opening and are susceptible to moisture deterioration.
The food was delivered late, and the food was cold. After it was cold, it was dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it.
And the soup spilled out.
Cancel immediately, the things he #PRS_ORG# sent must be cold.
I didn't take it!!

If you want to pay the rider for the service, how can I?
A rider was confirmed more than an hour ago.
I don't want to wait any longer.
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do" it, and then telling you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either do your best at once, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will be recognized as "correct" by anyone who looks at it, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, reinvent yourself, and make a 180-degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For a person who sticks to the rules, conforms to the old ways, and refuses to change, you must shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the word "change" and will not move forward, making it difficult to make a decision; or they will make a determination to "change" with a sudden impulse and take the first step bravely, but often it is not a long time, and they will not persist for a long time before they lose, and it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk of "Starting Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability, making the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is the way that it is possible to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages the theory that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: Because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing it.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success that follows the "second best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is ostensibly a success for all, it ultimately inspires a few, while the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
No one answered the phone.
Keep delaying.
It hasn't arrived yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How can I contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He missed two meals, but one order was over.
I would like to ask how to contact the rider.
Just now the first rider told me that there should be another rider to deliver.
The resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters: Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to the previous year, to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu," is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to the large number of human hunts and the increasingly degraded environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, and in 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake to fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and major rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have been increasing year by year through measures such as artificial breeding and discharge, cleaning up the main river channels of Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passageways."
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, the Qinghai Lake naked carp has been artificially propagated and released nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment in the source areas of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and has established a comprehensive management system for the prohibition of fishing in "one river, one lake."
I ordered food over $180 with a #PRS_ORG# RED credit card.
But the order did not deduct $20.

The restaurant only brought me a bag, to be put in the bag, the weather is cold.
Would you like to ask, is the takeaway in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or if someone took it away, thanks
It's been an hour, and it hasn't arrived yet.
I just saw an article about the official holiday. It's too long.
Give men who don't know science popularization.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first regular holiday on a certain day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, it will be more regular once a month.
But it is not regular enough to be able to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck will turn over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; some people have less blood flow, some people have a major blood avalanche; some people have no reaction, some people have pain to be transported away by ambulance, and dysmenorrhea will change over time.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, and bleeding is 24 hours within a few days from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary napkins or tampons to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen quickly before the beginning of the physiological period can effectively relieve the pain in the month. It is useless to eat after the beginning of dysmenorrhea.
Due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release before the physiological period, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about to cycle, inexplicable diarrhea, basically two days will come menstruation.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to replace them 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 tablets. If you add the prepared portion, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify it here, the tampons don't have to be changed often, they can be changed every five or six hours, and the maximum is eight hours).
The hormones during menstruation may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will make itself a stumbling block.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It is not just blood that flows, it contains the detached endometrial.
After menstruation, the endometrial membrane is the thinnest, and then thickens slowly. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and every month a house is built (the endometrial thickens) to welcome guests, but the guests do not come, and all of it is removed (menstrual discharge).
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day every month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But people can be born because their mother has menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you for the first time when you come to this world to live in a house for 10 months, everyone should thank their mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the preparation of the female body for life is disgusting, and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking about it, never experienced it, never experienced it in this life, and men who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful, how can this attitude be so nice to face their mother, how can it be so nice to want their children?
Finally, sisters try the tampon, it really works.
Today is the winter solstice festival, the wrong delivery is more disappointing.
You need to order another meal for the children.
I hope the store will check the products in its busy schedule.
Is the foot bath tub soaking foot numb leakage electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a very good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot bathtubs are selling very well, but there is no special industry standard for foot bathtubs, so there are some safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt numb on the soles of his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he did not expect to turn off the vibration function, and his father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried with the electric pen, and the electric pen turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was good. Although he dropped the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what kind of materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath will not have the problem of live electricity, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take the electric pen test at will.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Wanpan correspondent Liu Xiaoling photographed Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhun, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony that the source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a 100 billion yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunan, four water and colorful tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and black tea have taken turns to promote the integration of tea tourism in the main tea producing areas, which has led to an increase in the income of tea farmers.
Feng Shui turns around, and black tea is strong again.
According to tea experts in the province, after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea plantations has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the license to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua welcomed the "Source of Lake Red."
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
With a touch of red, Xinhua black tea has injected the connotation of tea culture, and the popularity and trading fire have made the Xiang tea industry welcome the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, because there is no parking below, he can't deliver it.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "metaphysical, metaphysical, and metaphysical," which was translated by metaphysic by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era), a Japanese.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns represent only a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a method of studying God without saying a word.
Spiritual philosophy is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the rules of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (the evaluation of different moral views, and the recommendation of moral principles for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should follow, applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theories to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (the collection of information about how people live, summarizing from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contributed to the decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by Vara and Montaigne.
Part II: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part III: The ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli et al., modern ethics (17th and 18th centuries, British empirical ethics, represented by: Hume et al., 17th and 18th centuries, European rationalist ethics, represented by: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by: Voltaire et al., 18th and 19th century, German academic ethics, represented by: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18th and 19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by: Bentham and Sikivek, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by: Thomas Kellen, and other figures in the late 19th century, and the late 19th century, representative of Neo-German ethics, such as: Thomas Kellenklein, and Kellen, and the late 19th century, representative of the late 19th century, representative of the New Erniger, representative of the new, and the new, and the late 19th century.
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof."
Logic usually consists of three parts: Inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject that focuses on the study of the nature and significance of beauty.

That is the same as giving less. You need money for a chicken McLuck sauce.
You asked the restaurant to bring it up.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, so I spend so much money to order takeout.
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you for your humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I issued a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted so far.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started their families.
It was your kindness that helped us, the families in distress, through the most difficult times.
The COVID-19 pandemic is now raging around the world, and most donors have retired every year.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating to the Tiananmen Mothers Group, which is a difficult group for us. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way. Please understand!!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32 years of humanitarian relief work by the All-American Federation of Self-Education (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the All-American Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Relief funds often cannot be delivered smoothly to the hands of the Tiananmen Square.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special group was set up by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund," which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, the MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphans Relief Fund for the Elderly in Distress," which has been implemented since.
The funding for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th, from generous donations from individuals, and was supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Reform through Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, Human Rights in China also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4th donation is for the sake of the donors, and we are indeed all retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I would like to thank Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends."
We will respect the decision of the victims to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have been giving generously over the years and risking the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Thanks to Dandan for his recognition, your satisfaction will make us fully charged and continue to move forward, we will continue to refuel!!
This photography studio is really great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to the late stage, it is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and will match your makeup according to your style. The cosmetics are also big brands.
Not to mention Mr. Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere and two kittens play with them.
We work in Beijing, and all the better photo studios in Beijing need to queue up half a year in advance. My colleagues have filmed in Beijing, and I think it is just so so after watching the next film.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with a soul and an attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also a short version of most people. The photographer will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, an excellent team.
We and the people around us are full of praise.
I have recommended my best friend to the past, and my best friend was just as happy when she saw the film.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, more people will find ta, and shoot out their own style, rather than the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. Both are very creative and creative newcomers. We are creative studios. As long as customers like us, we will do our best to complete it.

Thank you Xiaoyu for your review It is also a fate to know you from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao The trust in us is thousands of kilometers away so much I am very happy to meet you and have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I give the money?!
The re-delivered meal has been delivered.
No rider received.
Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to conduct training, but if you don't have the idea, it is better to study by yourself. After all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
The first thing to look at is the number of teachers in this institution. If the number of teachers is not strong enough, this training institution is of no significance. Of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing the training institution, it is best to inquire about the students who come out of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will all have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline training institutions are actually very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more, and the basic need is 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if this is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources on the b station. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for your study, then it is recommended to study at a training institution, so that you don't have to work very hard, the teacher explains it in detail, and there are special questions to be answered, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal promotion places, and recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview process of looking for a job can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions. As I said before, I don't know your situation, so I only introduce it in general and not in detail. If you have other people you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, and I saw it all in the app.
What is it called?
I haven't finished yet. What are you doing?!
I, undertake all kinds (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall mounted furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, lampblack machine, installation of lamps, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, housekeeping service.
Thanks to those who silently give me praise, hard work for life life is very tired but to continue.
Life will not disappoint everyone who has worked hard, just pay attention to me if you like, and thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own process, in the face of life, we are strong, is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of heart.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and see the satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort will pay off!!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and keep the good.
The details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping has helped you to achieve the "net" I can, and serve love home.
Keep Wanjia clean, tree housekeeping monument, service in place, clean to home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, it will be dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it overflow its luster. The same is true of life.
We can succeed by doing it with our heart, and we are serious about creating exquisite beauty sewing with meticulous care.
Give me the opportunity, will make you satisfied, quality says everything, because the professional is trustworthy, your recognition is my most encouraged!!
All walks of life are not good at the moment!!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The plan of the day is in the morning, and all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and happiness, and keep a good mood all day.
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and when I had it, I was happy; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and when I reached it, I was happy; when I matured, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and when I understood it, I was happy.
Be the truest and kindest of yourself, walk according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; life is a road, walk your own way; two treasures of life: Good health, good mood, beautiful and live forever!!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, it is not the ability that binds you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
The First Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter: Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on December 11 at the Diriyah JAX Art Zone, located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Huanyu, curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Inheritance as an Experiment," "Thinking on the Edge," "Going to the Public," "Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art, and performing arts; the works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted attention, and some artists created with recycled materials in a novel way, such as Xu Bing, who reconstructed a classic landscape painting from waste in "The Story Series of the Stream and Mountain Endless Picture" (2014).
Buckley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that the Biennale would establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Tian said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, not only to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Standardizing the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance to the poor and consolidate the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently issued policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare job management, helping to promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs, at present, 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as the labor force, which plays an important role in helping people out of poverty to achieve employment and income, consolidate the achievements in poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations, jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly standardize the scope of targets, fund management, job development, and job management for grassroots recruitment for rural public welfare positions.
In terms of job development and establishment, the new regulations clearly state that the establishment shall be based on the principles of "setting up posts according to needs, assigning people to posts, dynamic management, and total volume control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, announcement, employment, pre-job training, and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also specify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare jobs, and stipulate that rural public welfare job development departments should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for rural public welfare job placements; and require the relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public welfare job subsidies.

Hello,
Can I cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the Rightists have a period of success in history, it is not long, so it is short because if you give a little sunshine, you will be bright, and if you drink a little boiled water, you will sweat.
But to be realistic, the Rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, and political groups will be mixed, and then foreign countries will take advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China's attitude of being patient and responsible for the country and the people, political speculators who try to make a chill in the fire, that is not the right, it is a bastard.
Talk about it again.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not have this creation, because what the left wants is the dross that the Communist Party throws away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends who were fighting against the thieves while refuting the left epilepsy, and they were still very angry.
Do not try to reason with the traitor and the left epilepsy. They are all a child, and there is no reason to talk.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not want to let the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit, why?
I tell my friends this: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, and when the left is scolding you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually away, and even the dragon slaughter youth eventually become a dragon.
I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China as a whole should be left-leaning due to the innate genes of history and culture.
In China, the right wing is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and it is certain that the left will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, it's over if I like it.
Don't say anything, Huahua is so generous.
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US Empire has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses for "American" enterprises.
The US empire suppressed the Chinese chip industry and required its own companies and related companies from allied countries to block the Chinese chip industry at the same time. The direct result was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which led to a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the autonomy of the "chip," technology giants in more and more countries have begun to "de-beautify" the road.
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and the United States have recently made frequent moves to host the "Chip Summit"; they have also invited giants from 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, a veteran technology giant from the United States, has invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and open up chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to rob TSMC of its "rice bowl."
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, which will surely rise rapidly in the short term to defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, and he had no scruples about Intel's investment in building a fab. He said bluntly: Intel is building a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou is still resentful of a grudge between the front office and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the manufacturing industry in the United States, the peak of the world, and the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model makes some small businesses overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be prohibitive in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, in the 1980s, division of labor and cooperation began to appear in the chip industry. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, it was possible to set up a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC has targeted its main business at the single link of "wafer processing" and does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a small minion in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obvious that it had a high self-esteem and despised TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I did not expect that the giant who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in the past, but now also want to start wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the foundry.
Today, the market value of TSMC has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC is already sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
No, no.
At 19:06, the order was placed for 2 hours.
Come and see some strange hot searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: February 2, the rise of the dragon, the price increase of Holly Friends, and the goods pulling incident, the spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, and if there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They seem to be no different from the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] that was displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?!
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peaks], [jagged], [cliff].
[Lone Peak] is artificial heating, which quickly rushes to the hot search list and attracts public attention; [Jagged] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched on the hot search list; [Cliff] is a collective withdrawal, and the hot search has completed its "function" and received new tasks and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is the trough of another event, and the time is not different. It must be the unified batch of sailors who receive the task and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: Dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popularizing science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, which coerce decision-making, and the black production accounts are conducted in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all factors in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, leaving aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks will leave traces, such traces, we will dig them out together.

Mauritius and other countries found the first case of Omicron strain infection - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua News Agency): Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus strain Omicron.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country for the first time on October 10.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa, and the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. He tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After isolation treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected patients turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three are students, and they returned from a trip abroad earlier this month. They were all mild and were not hospitalized.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Kunbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has found three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time.
The country's health authorities sequenced the genomes of 12 new crown positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Daimei 360 Integrated Home Decor
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No.156 Huancheng South Road.
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
This is the first time I went to the store just showed them my hut map, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they could actually give me a quote saying that my house of 135 and 70,000 can be handled, and I probably showed them their materials and I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that as soon as you get to the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the money, you will never be able to return it unless you have enough experience to fight a theoretical battle with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
The offer he gave me had a lot of problems 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets bathroom, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in the company, and I signed the contract without making it clear at the beginning.
When I went to them for a refund, they showed a very experienced look and had a small team to deal with you.
It is the customer's problem that they will bite to death anyway. They are completely irresponsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, there are many details, I don't want to say all of them are tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend asked them to decorate the house is also not good quality, and I will calculate all kinds of expenses for you later.
Hang Daddy, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, now changed to Daimei, it seems to be closed down and changed to other.
So don't choose such a decoration company.
In the future, when you choose more Baidu look at these check these consulting because the decoration is not a small money.
To ask a question to a merchant, please log in or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of business reviews, please see the merchant inclusion statement for details.
Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest business information such as Daimei 360 integrated home improvement address, telephone number, business hours, etc., to find decoration company decoration company, on the public comment.
So horrible, please cancel the order if it is less than 30 minutes!!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then you don't cancel this conversation. If I don't refund my money in 5 to 10 days, I will pursue it.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.
The saliva chicken should be cooked, but the meat received is raw, so there is no way to eat it.
The Geminid meteor shower ushered in on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great shower on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, together with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteors are slow, colorful, and there are many firestorms, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will be at its peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant point is directly overhead under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was very impressive, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the intensity will be reduced."
The 14th is the 11th of the 11th lunar month, and the moon phase is a convex moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the middle of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the late hours of the night after the moon, but pay attention to cold and warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place in the suburbs or villages with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide field of view facing the northeast, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and you can observe it visually."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower all the time.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous meteor shower, you should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential.
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
As I understand it, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TVs, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for large-screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally 75 inches or more, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales in the world has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason why we have such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions than the backlight of LCD TVs, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
The experts from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the Beijing Union Hospital of Ophthalmology obtained 144 test data from a rigorous comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs on the market is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must be reasonable.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projection.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and they can achieve a large 100-inch screen experience within a short distance. The space required is small, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies, such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video and audio players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has pros and cons.
To put it simply, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector, a laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate that projection manufacturers use diffuse reflection as a selling point for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. You diffuse it to the ceiling, and the eyes can't see it.
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be an image at all.
It is just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Photography Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store has no branch store for the time being.
After adding the WeChat appointment date, my little sister sent me the optional time schedule, and the reply information was more timely.
Before I went, I saw the shooting works in the store, and more of them were outdoor wedding dresses. The shooting was very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my little sister, and patiently helped me try two sets of my tangled style clothes, and finally decided to start makeup styling. The photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and will be more refined in every detail.
But maybe because I didn't share my specific shooting ideas, the style I wanted was not the one I wanted, but it should be a good-looking one.
After the shoot, the photographer will help to select the photos and exchange the style of the later period.
The repaired film will take about half a month, wait for the effect ~
The second time I won the photo class of the Overlord Dinner event ~ most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt and experienced different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, and the photographer in charge of the shooting is the younger brother of the post-95 generation. It still feels a little green, and I hope to give more advice to customers in the future in terms of shooting action guidance.

Home page, also take a look at Queenie ~
When you arrive at the store, fill in your name and phone number and then choose your clothes, you can choose any wedding dress, you can change three or four sets of clothes, it is quite patient, after you choose the makeup for a long time, the service attitude is also good, the back shooting will teach you how to put on the shape, it is that the face is so big, the refinement said it will take half a month, and it will be sent in three or four days, and it feels like it is no different from the original film.
The [environment] is generally good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and there is a studio inside.
[Service] very warm and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make up for it.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit too much. The original double eyelids were pasted out of the three eyelids.
The eyebrow tail was also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't thrush their eyebrows every day.
The photo was given for ten days, but the effect of the P picture is not very satisfactory, and I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I don't know what style I want to try two sets of results to pick and choose or choose a black dress Little sister said that this set is more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up my hair! The hair stylist and makeup artist are super patient in helping me to get the results very satisfied.
After I finished my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me throughout the process of posing. It was very easy and harmonious.
After filming, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos. My brother said that the ending of the film within 15 years was very satisfying.
I have not responded in 3 days... Because your system does not recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment.
I now have to pay the freight every time.
Can you waive it first, and then charge my monthly fee after you have finished your investigation, is that OK?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of the conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: Shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before they can be established, and the approval of the CIRC must be obtained.
These three are actually very harsh, and to sum up, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the CBRC (which supervises insurance companies and banks throughout the country), and to have a good style of work by shareholders. As an insurance brokerage company, the insured need not question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all, there are three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies sell their star serious illness insurance on this platform, such as the latest Hutai Super Mary No. 5 serious illness insurance, the claimant and the insurer are both Hutai Life Insurance, and Umbrella Insurance is only a third party intermediary, so don't question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment mode: The products of the Internet platform are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the salesman salaries, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of the insured to pay fees, and at the same time, they can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is very good.
You can consider.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health information and occupation, non-insurance employees often add their own subjective awareness when they insure, and feel that they are healthy or fit, so there are many hidden dangers in claims, and there is a risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Weibo" (which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform, like Little Umbrella), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable, and the people who are not reliable are people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channels, and there are many sales misinformation.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance of 6 million yuan, buy insurance to send mobile phones, and receive 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid serious problems and will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is required according to the normal charge, ranging from dozens to 200, and many customers deduct fees for a year or two to buy their own is not clear.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million yuan (the world dropped the pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent by the special policy number such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not redeem it, and no one will remind you.
If you rely on this alone, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, what can you do? If you can't solve the problem, you will start to run naked in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misinformation of Internet insurance sales.
So, from a comprehensive point of view, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, saving each person 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per year in premiums.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, have served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on customer needs, shop around for customers during insurance, and try my best to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After taking out insurance, I will do policy sorting for customers, and policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although Internet insurance is not very "ceremonial" and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is a bit similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing," but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, that is, the subsequent service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us for many years to come?
So how can I contact the food delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is that going to pay me?
I said knock on the door to deliver the goods.
But the rider was left at the door, and then the man left.
It was also sent wrong.
Your rider has taken a takeaway from me at #NUMBER#, but still tells me to wait.
The rider received my takeaway at 19:25, but still refused to start.
I will go and buy it. Do you want any other takeaway?
What should I do?
Where did your rider go?
Still waiting?!
I want to send a ticket.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
But my food will have safety and hygiene problems.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that you should resist first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, and then making ridiculous posts, to the time you tried to post my home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure, humiliating remarks about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as appearance, body, good health, what kind of strawberries to grow in bed, whether to insert or not, and so on.
How do I know that later I received a number of friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing remarks.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer be silent.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not rein in at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, both sexes need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there would be a girl who would want to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?!
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think there will be any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I cut off some of the messages to comment on.
No one should be able to impersonate you if you post your own post.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
Smile.
Vietnam People's Daily - Prime Minister Pham Minh is attending the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major meetings were held, focusing on two themes: Digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nguyen Meng Hung, Minister of Communications and Media, said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of digital technology companies in Vietnam will continue to grow by nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam will be cultivated, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Meng Hung called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms, and to assume the task of developing these national digital platforms is to assume the national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technologies shared their breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promote the country's digital transformation, and economic recovery after the outbreak of the Zhu Hui epidemic.
In his speech at the forum, Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation is the only way for the world and an objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves all people, so it is necessary to mobilize all people to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and enterprises.
Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation should reflect the national spirit, and should be based on internal forces, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, with external forces as important and breakthrough points.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to drive deep and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, help green transformation and develop green energy.
Digital transformation requires participating in the establishment of databases that protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and customs, and promote digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management and development databases, and logistics.

The Yangtze River Main Stream Realized Full Coverage of the Water Green Comprehensive Service Area - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter: Wang Xian) Chongqing Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation on schedule on the 10th, which is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by the majority of crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of shipping on the Yangtze River.

Three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China Rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional report: Latest news on China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US naval arsenal is visiting Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, satellites spotted the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabac Strait.
The Barabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the U.S. aircraft carrier that is now cruising in the Pacific Ocean, there is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C Carrier Squadron for the first time, which is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the missile destroyer "Stockdale."
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three U.S. aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. carrier transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal visited Guam last weekend for a rare visit.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The rare visit to Guam by the three U.S. aircraft carriers to assemble the most powerful weapons around China is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrates the U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Thunder Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the United States mainland, as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta, and the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money today has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, are all traffic channels for Meta, regardless of their functional positioning.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many apps host Meta ads, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow apps to access their information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous Meta income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be circumvented, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from the byte in the first two years.
All the agents in China are helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and Meta is also doing very well in Greater China.
I haven't specifically learned about it lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at income, but also, more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told about the "meta-universe."
The meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite the fact that Facebook is now very beautiful, with annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis, and compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software now have a relatively high daily life and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is a blink of an eye.
But the unreachable concept of the meta-universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and is constantly looking for new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a way of no return.
