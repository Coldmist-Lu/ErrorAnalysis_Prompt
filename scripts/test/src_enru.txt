TV report left badly shaken after sex pest kisses her live on air
A TV reporter has condemned a stranger who pretended to grope her backside then kissed her live on air.
Sara Rivest recoiled at the man's attempted embrace while reporting on a bourbon festival in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday.
She said "Ooohkay," then "That was not appropriate, let's go to the story," as she regained her composure live on TV station WAVE.
The pest has been named as Eric Goodman, with Goodman now charged with misdemeanor harassment with physical contact.
He has been issued a summons to appear in court.
After their encounter, Rivest shared a clip on Twitter, writing: "Hey mister, here's your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!!"
And Rivest appeared on WAVE's evening news bulletin Monday to condemn the man again.
She conceded that people were perfectly entitled to behave foolishly in her shot while she was reporting from a public place.
Rivest added: "But when you put your hands on me or anyone else without their approval, that is wrong."
