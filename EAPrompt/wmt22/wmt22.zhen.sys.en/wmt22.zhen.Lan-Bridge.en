Students Sing the Leading Role at the Academic Annual Meeting of Zhejiang University
Washing hands with air, judging diseases with a long breath, and accurately searching for the source of haze. Last night, a series of insightful academic achievements were commended at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 annual academic conference.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, whose research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your Home medical Examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on a smartphone, whose size was half of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale gently, and the instrument will take a preliminary check on your health from the components of the air you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling air.
Smart bands on the market can detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, which is a new material. Its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" enables it to reflect its physical health more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent operating light: exquisite eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions, Switzerland.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, took a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"Early detection and removal of many diseases are not precise, which is related to the lamps used in doctors' operating rooms."
Shen Junfei said that if doctors cannot see all tumor tissues in time during early cancer examination, cancer cells will spread later.
The smart operating lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent operating lamp has been used in hospitals such as Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and others invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the sink, our weight can compress the air.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands clean!"
The color reaction and bacterial residue test prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A certificate that makes sense -- a first aid certificate.
This is one of the skill license I think that is important in addition to my driver's license!
Tips: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in case of emergencies, which means that it is a rescue before the arrival of ambulances.
As we all know, there is still a period of time after the accident when the ambulance arrives, which is the most important.
This is the time for first aid.
If I had a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, or a respiratory arrest, then our rescue time is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So how important it is for people around you to know about the first aid!
When someone falls around us, we can rescue him with professional knowledge instead of standing still and doing nothing. This helpless feeling is too terrible.
"In China, according to our official data, three million people die accidentally every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15 percent can be saved.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70% to 80% of them can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing."
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, it will make no sense in pinching people.
Artificial respiration and chest compression are necessary to rescue people.
I found that few people now have this awareness to learn first aid, but it is too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
You can sign up for the first aid certificate at your local Red Cross Training Center. I sign up at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. There are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be achieved before the age of 25. It was a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the target list, but it was indeed completed!
Then I'm going to take other certificates I want. I'm going to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first-aid certificate on Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first-aid certificate to take this certificate. In fact, the first-aid certificate is very useful!

Just one shrimp dumpling cost me 13 Yuan!
I have never tried this before
Why can't this be clearly expressed ?
13 yuan each?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed to deliver meals. Just one shrimp dumpling is for me this time!?
Because I saw it when I typed the code.
First of all, I personally think Four Seas is an all-round bad movie, in all senses.
But if the movie doesn't have any highlights, it's not at least a good match.
There are many kinds of bad movies, including those that make you sleep soundly in the cinema and those that make you feel indignant after watching. The Four Seas is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Han was really talented.
The most painful part of this film is that it seems to be a creation in a novel, hard to name, with many loopholes like a windbreaker suited on brother Ma.
You may even wonder if there is any metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, it is actually a piece of shit.
Let's start with some of the things that I can't understand.
The hero should live on an island in the south and live with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
The elderly in a van see the snow from south to northeast?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
And then there was no story about the old man.
How did the heroine and her brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gangsters on the island easily lockdown a mountain road??
Then the truck that sent the rebar in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and there was no truck driver around.
This is so obvious.
Why would a gangster with bad credit and suspicion of illegality become an auxiliary policeman?
Why don't you call the police in the face of usurious loans, and the police in the movie also asked if he got some problems?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but he doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel. Then he was required that he couldn't find the hotel owner and sat outside the room door and slept for a whole night.
This inexplicable plot fills the film, because the plot is so outrageous that I can recall them in pain.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the theme of the film, or the fact that the film has no theme at all, is an abominable stitch.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. More than 20 minutes later, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it halfway, you think it may be a feature film that wants to reflect the survival of the young people in the town. After watching it, you don't know what you have seen at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy such a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
For most people, they are also very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle rider, you can tell the audience how a talented rookie can succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, tell the truth about the stories between a young man who like to ride motorcycles and a waitresses .
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not contain things which are contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zhengyan's new motorcycle has just been burned and can still sing), so you can't open some brains that even Kennedy can't bear to see.
As for the fact that the heroine is not mentally disabled but acts like a 5-year-old child in some ways, I really don't know whether it is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I wonder why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen on adding a crash plot to his own movie.
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival to add to the audience?

Production and processing equipment for concrete module of inspection well Introduction to Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of domestic concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, shaft wall module machinery, from semi-automatic to full-automatic production line.
Through years of practice and development, the company now has excellent quality and mainly produces hydraulic, mobile and fully automatic inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Concrete module production and processing equipment for inspection well Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Production and processing equipment for concrete module of inspection well Characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
The brick masonry equipment of Yixin inspection well is widely used as new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
Such as various inspection wells, gutter inlets, square ditches, septic tanks, small structures and bridge wing walls of drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are of concave-convex groove structure, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of shaft wall is much better than that of flat friction masonry.
The module is of hollow structure. After combined masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the transverse holes are intersected. After the hole core is poured, a cast-in-situ concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The module is provided with steel dowel slots vertically and horizontally, and the transverse horizontal steel dowels and longitudinal steel dowels correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, water leakage and other phenomena. The wall module of the well wall has stable mechanical performance, simple operation and standard forming size.
The smart control of concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, and one-button touch LCD monitors the whole process of mechanical operation to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and material comparison, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of shaft wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic and conveying, double-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
For the modular brick machine of concrete inspection well, the traveling mould box of the distribution box is demoulded and lifted, the door of the storage box is closed, and the automatic conveying supporting plate is independently completed by the hydraulic system, thus reducing the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
The modular brick machine for concrete manhole adopts imported computers, electrical appliances and sealing hydraulic parts to ensure stable and reliable comprehensive performance of the equipment.
The mechanical excitation platform of the shaft wall module is made of integral plate steel, and there is no welding point for the linear cutting and mold closing of the table surface, so that the packing box can swing freely and guide, fully reducing mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the packing is combined into one to densify the amplitude, and the integrated, fully synchronous, table vibration and mold vibration are adopted to ensure the compaction effect.
The shaft wall module mechanical excitation machine and computer automatically control the amplitude according to the cost performance of raw materials to adjust the amplitude without wear braking, thus prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The shaft wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship System, and Enrollment means being an Associated Employees of Enterprises-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive the pilot training also have apprenticeships. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, the recruitment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises shall be standardized, and the dual identities of apprentice secondary vocational school students and enterprise quasi-employees shall be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, the apprentice, school and enterprise shall sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices aged 16 and below 18, the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise shall sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentice on-the-job training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises in the form of modern apprenticeship.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot period. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the internship will generally last for 6 months.
In practice in enterprises, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, Chongqing has determined 60 pilots of the municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship system in three batches, each with about 50 students, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of "pilot first, then implementation, and gradual promotion from point to area", we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint school-enterprise enrollment, joint training and integrated education, so as to effectively improve students' post skills and improve students' employment rate and quality.

China Children's Center is to hold a series of activities to let children enjoy the Children's Day by using "high-tech"-Xinhuanet
BEIJING, May 20 (Huang Xiaoxi Zhou Shanshan) -- China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities around June 1 Children's Day from May 28 to June 1, such as Children's Maker Experience, Children's Visual Arts Festival and Parent-Child Reading Carnival, so that children can spend June 1 in the charm of cutting-edge technology, the reporter learned from China Children's Center on May 20.
It is understood that the activities held by China Children's Center during the Children's Day this year include the Children's Future Learning Carnival, the first Children's Visual Arts Festival, the "Literary Carnival" and the "Family Loves Reading" picture book series activities.
Li Zhongming, deputy director of China Children's Center, said at the 2016 Children's Day Media Briefing on June 20, "Love Home and Create Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival is the key activity of China Children's Center to celebrate the Children's Day this year.
The activity focuses on the organic combination of social innovation and family personal creativity.

Doctors in South Africa: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the coronavirus Omicron variant causes more mild, though faster, diseases than the Delta variant.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a physician group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that their current treatment for COVID-19 patients had mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which were similar to flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, says he takes care of dozens of patients every day, but no one needs to be hospitalized.
Pi Lai said: "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of quarantine."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems who would have been more vulnerable to coronavirus infection.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta pandemic, he treated COVID-19 patients with "dyspnea and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are going to be hospitalized in a few days."
Other doctors shared similar experiences within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the conclusion of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half of the proportion of severe illnesses in the previous wave of outbreaks; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, compared with 20% of the early outbreaks in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports and said: "At present, almost all signs suggest that this is a milder disease."
"It's still early, and we need later data," he added.
Hospitalizations and deaths are usually late, while we entered the wave only two weeks later."
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of SARS-CoV-2, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the pandemic.
According to health officials, new cases confirmed in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Educational Review: What should be done to save abducted children?
If the famous public service advertising slogan of "no killing without trading" is compared, in a good environment without the demand for "abduction", mass prevention and mass treatment and anti-abduction by the whole people will make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and find abducted children in time.
I heard that the app is called "reunion", and I felt warm.
The new technology is not only literary and artistic, full of feelings, but also properly applied, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can enumerate many "big words".
However, prior attention should be given to the personal safety of victims before the abduction case is resolved.
Under the urgent purpose of "rescue", topics such as "whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be punished by the death penalty" with different opinions and controversies can be put on hold and discussed cautiously, but the rescue of abducted children is not allowed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to moving away from the location of the crime as soon as possible after they have committed such crime.
A minute more delay in searching for abductions, the child may be more away from parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by a point.
In this circumstance, it is indeed pragmatic to come up with an effective method such as the "reunion" platform that directly contributes to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a major task that requires the functioning of the entire legal system.
There is no need to implement the care of "nursing the young and helping the weak" in cracking down on crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice and the rigorous enforcement of law.
In addition, the prevention of child abduction can be done better, from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at a railway station, and their parents fall asleep before waking up to find their children missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but parents of young children should have at least considerable protection awareness.
Parents taking turns resting, or placing their children under safe protection, are the basic means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the side that buying abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongful act is often only a link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the property confiscated.
The crime of child abduction and sale is obviously a crime with a high penalty point and a heavy maximum sentence, under the general trend of "lightening the penalty".
But there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising children.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we must not rely solely on the strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the abductors and traffickers will be interested and constantly innovate the means of abduction, forming a situation of "fighting against law" with law enforcers, and the anti-abduction action will be inefficient.
Therefore, the elimination of backward ideas and the popularization of common legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong Publicizes the Spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress in Malan Mountain
Draw on the Striving Force from the CPC's 100-year Struggle History
Hunan Daily, December 10 (Omnimedia Reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and Director of the Publicity Department of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, gave an interactive speech in Malanshan Video Cultural and Creative Park, thoroughly studied and implemented the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions on Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong explained the core meanings and practical requirements of the spirit of the plenary session in a simple and comprehensive manner from three aspects: ideals and beliefs and original aspiration and mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leaders and party theories, combined with his own perception and personal experience.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the plenary session with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions on Hunan's important speeches and the spirit of the provincial party congress, integrate them, enhance the ideological, political and action consciousness of defending the "Two Establishments" and "Two Maintenances", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin oil and refined oil.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matters.
According to different acidity, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin: the highest grade and quality olive oil, and a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, elegant and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity less than 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, containing pure taste and aroma.
Ordinary Virgin Oil: Favorable taste and flavor, with acidity no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Ordinary olive oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to mix taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent and pale golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or olive residue oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution and refined.
Looking at the grade classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like wine-making grapes. Olives from different regions and varieties produce different standards of olive oil.
Best growing ground for olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions for olive growth, such as soil and air temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, it can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. with similar climate.
Picking months of olives:
From March to June every year, it is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruits. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transition from green to red, purple, and finally turn black.
November to February is the picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Fire of Freedom Never Goes Out
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by President Biden of the United States and attended by leaders of governments and civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, concluded Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world and could never be extinguished by an authoritarian regime.
He also said he plans to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a Taiwanese government representative and councillor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democratic human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the next day's summit.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before that, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world."
Biden also said defending democracy required a joint effort by society as a whole.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the barriers of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to authoritarian cushions and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said."
The next day of the "Democracy Summit" was devoted to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authority, and countering digital authority and affirming democratic values.
The day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech that day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution."
Luo Guancong, a democratic human rights activist in Hong Kong, addressed the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, such as Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long embraced China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CPC.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the China market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
In attending a round-table discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan's executive councillor, Tang Feng, released a National Statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of confronting authoritarianism and authority.
He also shared his experience on how to fight COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"We have always been firmly at the forefront of the global confrontation against authoritarianism and have taken a leadership role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it."
In parallel with the agenda of the second day of the Democratic Summit, the United States Department of the Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't hold on, so I want to find a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If it cannot be distinguished, the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than cheap beats. This kind of "primary racket" is actually industrial waste.
They are at a very low-intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot resist, even a master player will find it difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is --- Tennis is so hard, knowing that you can't learn it, and knowing that you don't want to buy expensive, you can't play twice, and you won't play again, so this racket is cheap, and you don't care.
When you can really tell good from bad, it means that you have improved, and then come to me to buy expensive, I make money twice.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand better racket at a similar price, such as prince or Deng Lupu. The two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets cannot be sold at a high price. New rackets of RMB 500 and RMB 600 are good, while second-hand rackets of RMB 200 are not. Isn't it good to have a racket of RMB 1,000?
It's friendly to novices, but it's hard to pass the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed for many times
May I help you follow up?
Postponed
Thank you

Do I need to reorder next? So I don't need to care about that order?

Girls use arrows as targets to raise money for their sisters: " It's okay to think of flesh wounds"-Xinhua
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "Human Target, RMB 10 per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl is willing to be 'target' to raise money for her sister" was posted on Moments.
A girl stands in front of a slightly higher-than-human wooden board with the words "human flesh target, RMB 10 per arrow" written on it, indicating that she can use a bow and arrow to shoot after the payment.
This behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such aggressive moves for her sister's donation, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl being a street "arrow target" for fundraising has been accused
In the picture posted on the Internet, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, RMB 10 per arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account, WeChat account and Alipay account written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image was controversial when it went online.
Some netizens believe that this is "eye-catching begging", and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We found it when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers."
In an interview with local media, police at the Tianshui Police Station near the incident site said that there were two girls, both about 20 years old, dressed up beautifully.
Among them, the girl who is a "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; another girl on the side shouted, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and now urgently needs surgery fees who need people's help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the reporter of the Beijing News that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, who raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, there is no good way to raise funds for the moment, so it did this.
He said that in the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows in the whole process, but someone watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police's identification by the security department, the use of bows and arrows does not belong to the scope of control.
"This eye-catching approach to fundraising is not advocated," the director said.
She left the police station after being warned and admonished.

Personally, I think Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. The game performance: the game performance is comfortable and the laptop can handle most of the games. My full-height setting for PUBG on ** frame rate is stable and the display is really smooth. Lol is not easy to talk about. CSgo is also easy to play. Most of the 3A games can be handled on the laptop.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is very powerful, working situation is quite quiet, when it's at the highest game settings, the fan effect is not small.
Appearance material: The appearance is cool, and the gaming laptop is originally cool. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and playing game with the resolution of 1080P is enough
I thought it was really good to buy a laptop. It was mainly used for design. It was cost-effective, lighter than I imagined, and better-looking than I imagined. The red on the back was in a very beautiful wine color, which was not so vulgar. The overall value was much higher than expected. It was worth buying, and it was also suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I started to use Acer Night Knight. After two years of use, it is cost-effective and of excellent quality!
My friends also recommend this product!
This series of 3 machines have been purchased!

I bought it for my nephew. I wanted to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he was in urgent need, so I bought it in advance, so I didn't catch up with the big bank activity, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost performance is quite high, and the logistics is quite fast. Let's take a while to follow up.
New original, cost-effective gaming laptop, great design style, and windows 11 and office 2019 have been already installed on it
Display effect: I bought it for my child for 3D rendering. The software has been installed. The child said that it can be used. This computer can be used for 3D design.
I bought it for my son. He said it was good.

It's not bad. The display quality of when playing games is excellent.
What was the hottest in 2021?
It's definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was an article named "Look! "Project Managers Can Attack Gold Medal Olympic Projects" is a very popular article, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can compete with them: It is the daily routine of project managers to move bricks, go on business trips and stay up late, and it is even more difficult for them to fight fire, carry on business and apologize.
An article that seems to be joking also shows the daily sorrows of project managers, which means that they are unable to do the current project management work.
And the personnel engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma of work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP applicants, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the Twenty-Year Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 PMP® applicants in China, about 420,000 PMP® certified applicants and about 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply take the previous "old experience". The rapidly changing working environment lets us know that we should learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP ensure smooth project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points such as ten major fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when it comes to project management.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: poor cognition of project management, simple reliance on personal experience, lack of project management theory and no idea how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to be implemented in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delay of projects; unclear division of labor among members, unclear "old Youtiao" in the team, unsmooth cross-departmental assistance and communication, and difficulty in promoting projects ...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, it has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has won the honorary titles such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base", came with the online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers".
Online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results with lower cost and less investment.
If there is no evidence, you can first see how other trainees evaluate this course: this course is not only provided by Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (former Huawei R&D management team), but also provides in-depth and simple professional explanation of the course content in combination with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods and rich template forms to help trainees convert what they have learned into specific work after class.

Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double 12"-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News
During this year's Double 11 Carnival, the transaction amount of national online payment business reached RMB 1.77 trillion, a record high compared with previous years.
A variety of red envelopes and eye-catching live-streaming sales have once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom has made people marvel at the increasingly strong national consumption power; on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the Double 12 Shopping Festival, Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy to remind users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Survey and Analysis Report on Consumer Financial Literacy released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will remain the focus of financial education; The China Youth Debt Report released by Nielsen and the China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020 released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of the young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation shows a rational consumption trend as a whole, although it is quite different from the "excessive profligacy" label pasted by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks are generated, and even social problems gradually increase. Financial enterprises should be brave to assume social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.

Vietnam People's Daily-GCC addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopovers include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected GCC internal solidarity and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement between the United States and Kuwait to mediate towards "solidarity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
Resolving differences to restore relations with Qatar in the Arab States of the Gulf stems from the need to unite in the interests of States and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the visit to Oman, the Saudi Crown Prince agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbors.
A 725-kilometer corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and supply chain integration for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest USD 5 billion in Oman, and 13 memorandums of understanding worth USD 30 billion have been signed between the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's visit to the Gulf states coincided with talks between Iran and the world's major powers over the salvage of the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Gulf's Arab states for perceived inability to resolve their missile problems with Iran.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term "rival" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States consider it flawed to fail to address Iran's missile problem and to act to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran in the context of the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states in their nuclear talks with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors which slows economic growth in GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of its kind since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic outcomes that contribute to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to allow its member States to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercars in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This time our team brings you this car that is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million rmb, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand rmb, four-wheel drive, why called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably the case with myvi.
The low body, the arrogant scissors doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine, which offers a panoramic view of the glass, which perfectly illustrate the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the car model. Just google it by yourself. The editor sorted out some comments that google may not give!
Too much attention. Everyone was watching wherever they went. It was uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
The fuel cost per 1 km is about RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice getting on and off the car, or it will be a little awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is so loud that you will be deaf immediately after getting off the car. (But it's still cool)
The car body is too large, so parking in an ordinary parking space will be very narrow, afraid of being knocked when the next car door is opened!
It's a little lonely because there is no opponent on the road(The editor speaks for himself, has nothing to do with the owner of the car, haha).
Don't get me wrong. The supercar is not for sale. Sorry!
Friends who want to video your car, please contact us!
More auto information you don't know is in The Car Guide / People's Auto Guide
The accident is worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that everyone knows that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also one million!
Just a few minutes ago, a foreign country hit a million sports cars 911 and ten million supercars Chiron!
Look at the results, expensive for a reason!
Let the University Spirit Resonate with the Spirit of the Times-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "empowering virtues to help the world and improving peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the competition in education, science and technology and talents is intensifying worldwide. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the Overall Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines not only shows China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, but also puts forward higher requirements for university development.
How to make efforts to become one of the world's most popular universities in a short period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, universities should give full play to the three advantages: The first is the late-mover advantage. By continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, the academic level and school running quality can be significantly improved.; The second is the cultural advantage, which inherits the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over the past 5,000 years and promotes the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, build brand and enhance image.; The third is institutional advantages. Give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven development, pool consensus and synergy, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to catch up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university into a single university, and each university must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School-running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running schools: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education and school-enterprise integration, and form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements.; Third, highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to continuously adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonance.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, moral cultivation, discernment and down-to-earth" and the common values of "enlightening the river, enlightening the truth and being kind, exploring the former people and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the university to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "All rivers run into sea" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "talents from all over the world are for me", and reflects the high-quality concept of learning from world-famous schools; "Enlightenment and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that while pursuing truth, universities should also accept the cultivation of virtue and the forging ahead of personality; The spirit of reform and innovation embodies the spirit of seeking innovation in knowledge and scientific research, as well as the spirit of reform, development and innovation; "Treating our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always share the same prosperity and humiliation with the national destiny.
These spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The intelligent person hears in silence, the wise person sees in the unformed ".
Colleges and universities in China should further grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we will adhere to humanistic care and freedom of independence, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation stir each other, thus providing inexhaustible power for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At a time when NFT emerged, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn stable incomes.
Axie Infinity is a pet-growing game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various games such as NFT. It is the NFT project with the highest turnover at present, and has exceeded USD 3 billion so far.
According to data from TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to the Honor of Kings.
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity conveys a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players can no longer be a single character, but can participate in the governance of the game ecology in addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but by blockchain technology.
When I read a piece of news about my friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is that enterprises should first choose industries with large growth potential, at least more than RMB 100bn in market size, and then choose industries with good future growth potential, considering the industries with the best growth potential in the next 3-5 years, and finally choose industries supported by policies.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right", that is, do the things right.
And strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding the direction, tactics lies in landing, and there is room for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, on the basis of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it can be considered whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on the basis of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On top of improving activity engagement (tactical thinking), consider how to set the right activity KPIs to achieve the right activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; Based on the improvement of DAU (tactical thinking), it can be considered whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin met several milestones events in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated Bitcoin as the legal currency, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the United States Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking another expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure as the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landed on the United States capital market.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

American-Asian group complains of discrimination in admissions to three famous Ivy League schools including Yale-Xinhuanet
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xu Jianmei)-More than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education and Justice on May 23 against three Ivy League schools -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- that discriminate against Asian applicants in the admission process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants eligible for admission to United States top schools had multiplied in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-American applicants in the three United States top schools remained basically the same.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" process.
According to Zhao Yukong, the research of Sang Desi and other scholars in 2014 shows that Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants in the three universities.
Data from the United States Department of Education also show that Brown and Dartmouth have the lowest percentage of Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expected the United States Department of Education and the United States Department of Justice to conduct an investigation after filing a complaint, and to take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment.
They also hope that the complained universities will take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change the admissions policy for Asians.
At present, the three universities under complaint have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian Education Alliance complained of discrimination in admissions to Harvard, but the United States Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese groups in the United States, there are also Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups in the United States.

In September 2020, Mr.Lu learned from the housing intermediary that a factory building was located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site visits, Lu Xiansheng decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr.Lu negotiated with Lin Mou, the owner's family, on the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted RMB 200,000 as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin Mou signed the Receipt for Plant Sales Deposit as the payee, which stated: "If the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit shall be paid by the seller. If the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double, and both parties agree to sign the plant sales contract within one week."
However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the sales scope and payment method of the plant, the housing sales contract was delayed.
Considering that both parties could not reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, several days later, Lin Mou returned the deposit of RMB 200,000 to Mr.Lu.
Mr.Lu was helpless and angry when he finally paid the deposit and the house payment was ready, and the seller refused to sell the house.
Therefore, Mr.Lu sued Lin Mou to the People's Court of Yuyao.
After hearing, the court held that the parties finally failed to sign a formal contract, which cannot be attributed to the defendant alone and should be reasonably presumed to be a failure of negotiation. Therefore, the down payment penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the down payment.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Reminder from lawyers] Necessary duty of care shall be exercised in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer shall fulfill the necessary duty of care, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Voice of Germany, Chinese) After the Democratic Summit on Friday, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday (December 11) that the "Leaders' Summit on Democracy" held by the United States was "to instrumentalize, weaponize, and pseudo-democracy in the name of anti-democracy, incite separatist confrontation, and shift domestic tensions."
According to the Chinese government, "the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others for a long time, carried out 'democracy', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', with disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to intervene.
The summit was Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting took place by video, with 111 world leaders invited, including Taiwanese, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
At the international level and within the United States, there are voices of skepticism, such as criticizing invited leaders with authoritarian autocracy, such as those in the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who suspect that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Germany's new prime minister, Scholz, also attended the VDS
In a statement by China's Foreign Ministry on Saturday, "American-style democracy today is a pathological manifestation of the growing problems of monetary politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic contradictions, and the division between the rich and the poor," and democracy in the United States is a "game of the rich" based on capital.
In his statement, United States President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the barriers of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to authoritarian cushions and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good."
Democracy, he stressed, is not to be taken for granted, "We must constantly update it in every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need to be defended by fighters in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a one-year operation after the Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions before the Entity Democracy Summit scheduled for late 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."

How to drink the Red Label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like to collect, some like to eat, and some like to taste wine. Red whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and it has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of red whisky has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, it will spoil its mellow aroma.
So how do you drink Red Label whiskey?
Let me give you a brief introduction.
How to drink Red Label whiskey:
Junior Red is a blend of about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a strong aroma and traditional Scotch whisky, with a sweet and smoky aroma.
Mellow and fresh in the mouth with a slight vanilla and intense smoky malt.
The wine can be served directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
In order to adapt to the taste of Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + cola or sparkling beverages such as Sprite or Novelty have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet beverages, in addition to neutralizing the acid taste, can visually bring people pleasure. The addition of beverages can dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste.
Red Label whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red square tastes a bit sour and astringent. Adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, while lemon will bring fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be blended according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whiskey. You can try it as a reference. I hope the editor's introduction can help you.
Educational Thinking: How to Make "Student Hegemon" and "Student Junk" Get What They Want-Xinhuanet
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the leaders of the university to reflect their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination and change the type of examination questions, so that the examination can truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college examinations have been a hot topic for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of abilities and different levels of learning.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings for the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination question type is single, the repetition rate is high, the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the examination by concentrated assault before the examination. If you think of other methods, you may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
As a result, the "strange situation" that "school jerks" can pass or even get high scores without investing; "school hegemons" never drop out of class, have good homework and notes, and are not much higher in examinations will emerge.
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that there is not no reason for the problems in the university examination, and it is believed that this situation is not only Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, the three students who wrote the letters were praised.
In fact, people who have been to college know that it is not uncommon for them to prepare for the examination, think of various ways to "take" the examination questions from teachers, strive to draw up the scope of the examination, and get "key guidance" before the examination. It is even not unusual to carry a small copy in the examination and ask teachers to be proud after the examination.
In the author's view, as a kind of teaching quality evaluation orientation, to measure the passing or failing of a university examination lies in teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and the scientific proposition on this basis.
In the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
However, the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, basically fixed.
As some teachers say, "20 years ago, I learned the basics of college mathematics, but now I'm still learning it,which is also the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many colleges and universities, examination groups are usually formed, and then senior teachers of the subject make up the examination papers. The examination papers are also marked by all teachers responsible for the subject, so that the repeated examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the actual situation of teaching and learning. The questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time, innovatively design the question type.
Examination is the baton of university education. The different kinds of examination means that students will have corresponding examination preparation plan, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letter of advice from students and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and comparative self-inspection of course completion examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
In terms of mechanism, it is necessary to solve the problems such as single type of examination questions and repeated questions. Of course, it is necessary to introduce corresponding systems. However, due to the high efficiency in daily work, teachers need to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation. If both ends are thoroughly understood, the teaching and learning will be better matched and a benign interaction will be formed, and the examination will also be more realistic, so that "students" and "students undergraduate" can get their own way.

Mrs. Kim's Wedding Photography (South Street) No branch for now
Before taking photos, we changed the time twice because we didn't schedule the time very well. Consultant Lan Lan patiently scheduled the time for us.
And then I chose a nice weekend for photograph.
Mrs.Jin's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are excellent.
It was the first time in my life that I formally put on makeup. Wow, I can't believe it. I will become so beautiful one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) makeup is super patient, makeup is natural.
The outdoor scene was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and it didn't feel very cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time. If there is something wrong, he will help us sort out immediately.
The photographer was also very humorous. We felt very happy after taking photos all day.
When choosing photos, I saw many cases on the Internet, so I didn't want customers to delete too many photos. However, when we chose photos, we didn't mean to add photos at all. We directly added 24 photos to the package, but none of them was added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos about the same time as me added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000. At that time, I was stunned and worried that I would choose too many photos.)
Today's photo was retouched, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two photos and I thought they were not good, so they immediately retouched them for me.
By comparing the previous photos of my sister, I think I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend you to take wedding photos of Mrs. Jin Xuanhan!
Series price: RMB 3,999
Jin Furen is grateful to you and sincerely wish you a happy and bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
Sabah's National Registry says it has been unable to issue newborn paper to newborn babies since early October because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper is used up. So far, 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the bureau's director, kerou aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for raw paper were recorded in the system and that security paper would be reissued when it arrived next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month report from an online media outlet referring to a Sabah newspaper print problem.
He said the problem appeared two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is the delayed arrival of China's manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper due to the pandemic."
He explains that Sabah newspapers use security paper that is different from other regions and therefore cannot borrow stock from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was handed over to the printing company on August 8 for partial printing.
"The agency will send personnel to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately, which is estimated to take two more working days (December 20) to deliver to the applicant."
"We will notify the applicant to go to each branch office to pick up the birth report paper . "
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspapers this year.
From 7:00 to now
Is that almost there?
I mean food

BEIJING, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, Dec. 12, commentator's article: A good start to the "14th Five-Year Plan" -- On studying and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference

48-hour nucleic acid test results are negative and a "buffer zone" is set up. The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities-Xinhuanet
BEIJING, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring personnel leaving land border cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) recently to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours and take at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame required above is from the date when each province, autonomous region and municipality determines the scope of the port city and announces it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities can set up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and the border residents of the two sides exchange frequently.
The differentiated zone management policy is implemented to change the prevention and control of spillover from one line of defense to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the barrier forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local aggregation outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this has exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, unimplemented closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, mere formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of all links of cold-chain goods, non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
According to the notice, efforts should be made to improve the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implement border control measures, so as to speed up the improvement of weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control without relaxation and scientificity, and strengthen the defense line against imported cases.
The notice stressed that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and livelihood security simultaneously, publish and smooth the livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate the emerging hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to the prominent problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in the notice include the counties (cities, districts and flags) where the open land, water and aviation ports are located, the cities (prefectures, prefectures and leagues) where they are located and the municipalities directly under the central government. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region and municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

YouTube Video: The Truth of the 20-Year Bloodthirsty Killing of the US Army-Xinhuanet
(Source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on YouTube platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity over the past 20 years.
Misuse drones to attack civilian sites such as hospitals and schools, distort humanity and set up killing teams.
For 20 years, American troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military has set up "black prisons" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity have sparked hatred among more Afghanistan.
As the video puts it, the more the American "war on terror" gets, the more it gets.
The war did not bring hope for peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only a devastated country and countless killings.
Click the video and let's reveal the truth of the bloodthirsty killings of the United States in the name of "counter-terrorism" and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally read the following article, discussing why the customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following article may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same.
So you're sure to ask: Why is the shelf life one year for bags and two years or more for cans?
Or ask: why is the price difference so big between bagged and canned milk powder?
From this point of view, many consumers or moms think that the quality is much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who say that the taste or flavor is different after eating!
Now let me tell you the reason why it is expensive to pretend to be expensive.
Why is the price difference so big for the same raw materials?
Most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high to be accepted by consumers, which means the profit margin of manufacturers is very low or there is no profit. How can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, the price of canonical costumes has increased significantly to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging rather than bagged packaging.
How come so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of RMB on advertising every year?
You can imagine that.
With the development of the society, the marketing expenses, such as promotion personnel, display expenses, gift expenses and advertising expenses, are also increasing.
So various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products which is the canned one, and its price is also rising, in fact, this is caused by the increase in market costs out of the new products.
The main purpose is to make higher profits. In fact, the cost of raw materials will not exceed RMB 3 or RMB 4.
In addition, in order to promote their products, some brands resort to the help of doctors in hospitals to promote their products, with profits ranging from RMB 30 to RMB 80.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow this method of operation, in fact, this method is to harm consumers.
It is suggested that you buy bagged milk powder into cans on the premise that there are cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
In addition, people should not think that the shelf life of canned packaging is longer than that of bagged packaging. If the shelf life of canned packaging is the same as that of bagged packaging after unpacking, it is just that the bagged packaging is not easy to store and is easy to deteriorate due to moisture.

Don't Frighten People at the Starting Line-Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
In today's books of success, many preach the "best principle"-that is, presuming or implying that you can "do" and then telling you what you need to do.
That is to say, the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" is overrun.
For this reason, these books have a common feature-either to do the best once for all, or to do nothing at all; to be 100, or to be 0; to climb Mount Tai, or to stay where you are.
This "best principle," admitted by everyone, is "right," but 99% of people are scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, make a great 180-degree change," which is a deadly weakness for many.
For those who are obedient, old-fashioned, and refuse to change, you have to shout in his ears, "You want to change, " which is undoubtedly self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "transformation" and will struggle to make up their minds; or they will be determined to "transform" on impulse and bravely take the first step, but the good times are often not long, and they will be defeated within a short time, and it is difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "From Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "Best Principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, leaving the vast majority of people "looking at Mönchengladbach".
Perhaps, the "sub-optimal principle" is a way to put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "sub-optimal principle" lies in "lowering the threshold"-it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories as big victories", that is, if you can't achieve 100, you can only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep, because it is always better than walking in place.
Anyway, if you do something, you're better than not.
Since the threshold is greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as they persist.
The road to success, following the "second best principle", is only a bit longer.
All in all, the "best principle," despite its ostensible success for all, can ultimately motivate, in fact, a few; and the "second best principle," can effectively motivate and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake's Gyrocarp Resources Increase by 7,100 Tons This Year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of gymnocarp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons from the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection period in 2002.
Gymnocarp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the ecological chain safety and biodiversity of "water-fish-bird" in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocarp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to factors such as man-made killing and the increasingly degraded breeding water environment of gymnocarp. In 2002, the reserve of gymnocarp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake Gymnocarp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Species in China.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish cultivation, and prohibited any institutions, collectives and individuals from fishing Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii and selling Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii and its products in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and releasing, cleaning the main river channels into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages" and other measures to continuously strengthen protection, the reserves of Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
According to Yang Lin, deputy director-general of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, up to now, nearly 180 million Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii in Qinghai Lake have been artificially proliferation and released, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Gymnocypris przewalskii przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake.
Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan Area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued fishing ban notices in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one lake".

I am wondering that if the take-out is packing in a bag?
We only saw one bag
I wanna know if it's missing, or if we've got it, thanks
It's been an hour, but it hasn't been delivered yet.
I just saw an article about writing a stunt. It's too long.
I'm going to popularize the science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual break one day between the ages of 13 and 15, with amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, they will come here regularly once a month.
However, it is not so regular that it can be accurately predicted. The travel time is about a week, so it needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, it won't follow the schedule due to bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days and some people have one week; some people have fewer abortions and some people have great hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, and some people are transported away by ambulance. Dysmenorrhea will change with time. Previously, pain did not mean lifetime pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding for 24 hours from the beginning to the end of the day, and all you can do is use a sanitary napkin or tampon to prevent blood from flowing to your clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. It is not necessary to take ibuprofen immediately before dysmenorrhea at the beginning of the menstrual period, which can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take ibuprofen again after dysmenorrhea starts.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, diarrhea is easy.
If it is about the end of the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, basically two days will come to menstruation.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove sleep time. The worst case is to change it six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces. If the portion prepared in advance is added, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece per month.
(Modify here. Tampons do not need to be changed frequently. They can be changed every five or six hours, eight hours in maximum)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, and ovulation will also be unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will trip you.
But official crime data show that women's ability to control their emotions is high, and there is no excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's shedding endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. The house is built every month (the endometrium becomes thicker) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, they will be demolished (the menstruation is expelled) and a new house will be built next month, which will repeat again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a month, abdominal pain and low back pain, who would like that?
But a person can be born because his mother has come to menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you to come to this world for the first time to live in a 10-month house, everyone to thank their mother regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women as dirty and shameful. People thought that was the case, but the time has changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is nauseous and that the woman's body is disgusting about the preparations for giving birth to life, they should not speak out in public. Girls should stand up and don't think so. They have never experienced it before, nor will they experience it in their life. Men who do not know much about it should not be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can they face their mother and how can they give birth to their child with such a attitude?
Finally, the sisters try the tampon. It works.
Today is the winter solstice festival, the wrong delivery is comparatively disappointing
and order another meal for children.
I hope the store will check the products even during the busy time
Foot bathtub bubble feet numbness is electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bathtub can play a good role in foot health care. Today, Gome will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bathtubs are more and more popular with consumers. A large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from more than RMB 100 to more  than 1000 RMB foot bathtubs, which gives consumers a great choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot bathtubs are sold well, but there is no special industry standard for foot bathtubs, so there are certain potential safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!"
Mr.Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bathtub as his father's birthday gift, but his father felt numb when soaking his feet.
At first, Mr.Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bathtub. Unexpectedly, after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in the soles of his feet.
When Mr.Li tried the pencil, it lit up. Li Xiansheng was surprised to find that the water in the foot bathtub was charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Despite withdrawing the foot bathtub, Mr.Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that the long-established foot tub now has no clear and detailed industry rules for setting the maximum temperature, what kind of people it is intended for, and what kind of material it is made to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, there will be no live problems in foot bathtubs, but it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.
So choose a split foot tub at the time of purchase.
Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take an electronic pencil to test it.
Opening of the 13th Hunan Tea Expo-Viewpoint Headlines-Hunan Daily-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (Omnimedia Reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan Correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo & Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held in Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, carry forward tea culture, and accelerate the goal of rushing to the tea industry worth RMB 100 billion.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Council of All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of Sichuan Provincial People's Congress attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony that the source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and the People's Government of Hunan Province have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the Hunan tea industry worth RMB 100 billion, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunan, four waters and five colors of tea".
The tea industry in the province has stepped up innovation. Green tea, dark tea, black tea and other major tea categories have taken turns to promote the integration of tea and tourism in the main tea production areas, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
Every dog has its day, and the black tea rises again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province say that after picking green tea, picking black tea and dark tea, tea farmers can earn money all year round, and the output value of tea gardens will increase sharply.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua welcomed the "Hunan Red Source".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants immediately placed an order for an alpine tea named "Binglichun".
Wang Zhun, Secretary-General of Zhejiang Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
A touch of Xinhua black tea is injected with the connotation of tea culture, which is popular with high trade volume, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy and aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase “The metaphysical is spiritual, the physical is carnal” in the Book of Changes Xi Ci I, which was translated by the Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji era) from metaphysic.
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extended problems.
The ontology is "to study which nouns represent the real existence of entities and which nouns represent mere concepts".
Metaphysical naturalism means denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, which is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodology Naturalism refers to research methods  without considering god.
Spiritual philosophy is a philosophical branch that studies consciousness and the nature of their relationship to the body（especially the brain）.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between the mind and the body".
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that discusses the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the subject of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behaviors).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (application of ethical theory to academics of actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics(collection of information about how people live, summarizing from the observed style).
Its examination of ethics is not based on the expected theory, but on the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice. It discusses the ethics held by social ethnic groups).
The history of ethics includes Roman ethics in Greece and Christian ethics in the Middle Ages.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Vara and montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part: the ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, Modern ethics(17th-18th centuries:Empirical ethics in the United Kingdom, represented by Hume et al.; 17th-18th Centuries: Ethics of Continental Rationalism, represented by Spinoza et al.; 18th century: Enlightenment ethics in France, represented by Voltaire et al.; 18th-19th Century: Ethics School of Germany, represented by Kant and Hegel et al.; 18th-19th Century: Utilitarian Ethics in the United Kingdom, represented by Bentham and Sikiwik et al.; 19th Century: Evolutionary Ethics in the United Kingdom, represented by Spencer, Huxley, et al.; late 19th century, Neo- Kantian ethics in Germany, represented by Li Kaier  et al.; late 19th century: Neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green et al.) Transition ethics (non-rationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.)
Logic is the discipline of the "principles and criteria of valid inference and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, attributive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is the subject of research on the essence and significance of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance that you have provided over the course of more than 30 years since the death of our relatives, especially since I personally appealed to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the old parents of most of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up to work.
It's your righteousness that has helped us families through the hardest times.
At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most of the donors are now in their retirement years.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donation to the group of mothers in Tiananmen, which should have drawn a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand!
Please accept my best wishes.
Tao Ye'an:please  allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Salvage money is often not delivered smoothly to the relatives of  June 4th Incident victimis.
In 1994, upon the recommendation of Mr.Ding, a special team was set up by "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian assistance funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphan Education Fund. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then established the June 4th Orphans Special Poverty Alleviation Fund for Lonely Old People , which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th Incident,from generous contributions of individuals, and support from the Democracy Foundation of the sister universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was only last year, after 31 years, that the families of the June 4th Incident victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4th incident.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian assistance projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the  donation for the sake of the donors, and  we are indeed retired seniors whose income is not as abundant as before we retired. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends.
We will respect the decisions of victims' relatives, terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to our chivalrous colleagues who have been generously and riskily delivering humaitarian aid over the years,

Thank you very much for choosing our product. Please read the following contents carefully in 5 minutes before using our chip:
Please check whether the goods are complete after unpacking.
If there is anything missing, please contact customer service in time.
The upper cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC.Do not pass through the solvent that reacts chemically with PC.
Do not use a hand-push syringe to directly inject the chip, otherwiseit is prone to occur liquid leakage.
The microfluidic chips of common substrates passed the pure water test at an injection pressure of 500 mbar (100 um channel depth) or 300 mbar (50 um channel depth) before delivery.
The glass substrate chips have passed the pure water test at an injection pressure of 800 mbar (100 um channel) before shipment. Please be careful not to collide with sharp objects during the use of the glass substrate chip, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
Please consider the viscosity of the solution during use and do not exceed this range, otherwise it will cause liquid leakage.
Under the condition that the injection pump uses pure water for injection, we recommend that the flow rate of the microfluidic microchip of the common substrate be set below 150 ul/min and the flow rate of the oil phase be set below 50 ul/min.
Please comprehensively consider the viscosity of the actual injection liquid, and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.
After the universal chip is tested, please clean the internal channel in time, otherwise it is easy to cause blockage.
Microfluidic chips are consumables and cannot be reused for a long time.
If the chip is damaged due to long-term use or improper operation, it will not be returned or replaced.
If you need a microfluidic chip that can withstand greater pressure or flow rate, please contact customer service for customization.

Series price: RMB 1,000
Thanks for Tuzi's comments. Originally, I had thought that you are not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the photos to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dan Dan's recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of passion and continue to move forward, we will continue to go for it!
This photography studio is amazing. I highly recommend all of you!
From reception, makeup, costume, lighting, photography to post-production, it is impeccable.
Makeup artists are very delicate, and they will match your makeup according to your style, and makeup products are also from first-tier brands.
Not to mention Mr.Tian Liang,he is quite professional in photography.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two small cats we can play with them.
We work in Beijing. Good studios in Beijing need to queue up half a year in advance. Some of our colleagues are shooting in Beijing. After watching their photos, I feel just so so.
I specially looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor. I think this is also the weakness of most people. The photographer Tian Liang is goodat capturing and records natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-designer constitute a good team.
We and the people around us are all quite satisfied with final photos.
I have already recommended my homie to go there, and she was also full of joy after seeing the negatives.
I hope that such studios will not be buried, and more people find it. Own pictures of their own styles, instead of being the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star comments of Zhanying and Jingling. Both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are the Creative Studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. We are grateful to meet each other.
Sweet and caring assistants, lively and cheerful photographers. Everyone in the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting and an unforgettable experience, and the shooting effect was much better than I thought. Thank you very much.
Thanks for Xiaoyu's comments. It's also a kind of destiny to meet you.It's thousands of kilometers from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, which is just the same as your trust of us. I'm glad to meet you. If there is opportunity, welcome to Qingdao again.

A programming rookie who wants to share personal experiences.
If you want to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training. But if you don't have such an idea, you'd better learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot and takes six months to learn.
However, training is indeed a good choice for those who intend to enter this industry, especially for those with weak self-control. Training is a perfect choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, it depends on the faculty of the training institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution is meaningless. Of course, some new training institutions are not very strong in faculty.
Second, before choosing a training institution, it is better to inquire about the students of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because you didn't give a certain introduction about yourself. Learnig has a lot to do with personal situation.
Things like major, age, the language you want to study, and even the city you are in will all be relevant to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or you have graduated from the computer major, I personally suggest that you study by yourself if you have enough time. This is the lowest efficiency and cost. Many offline and online training institutions are also doing well. However, first, the learning cost is high, and second, the time invested is relatively long, which basically requires centralized training for 3-6 months.
But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient.  Many online learning resources are free, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, some classic books can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not majoring in computer, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. In this way, it is not very difficult to learn. The teacher explains it in detail, there are also people dedicated to answer questions.In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements and there are internal promotion quota. After the training, you can be  recommended to the company,so that the later job interview process can also save a lot of things
These are my opinions. As I said earlier, I don't know your situation, so I only give a general introduction and don't give you a detailed introduction. If there is anything else you want to consult, please feel free to contact me for communication.
I said I'd be there by 1:00, I saw it all on the app
What do you mean
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?

Life will not disappoint every hard-working people. If you like me,just to follow me. Thanks to those who silently like me.
Life is like this. Others only care about the results and you support yourself in the process. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue.We can look back but cannot go back...
Cleaning is work and responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of attention.
Although we do the dirtiest work,we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude.When we see the customer's satisfied smile and thumbs up, all the tiredness at that moment is worth it, and the effort eventually pays off!
My daily work

Serve with heart, clean with heart, and retain the beauty.
You are concerned about the details, Fenggui housekeeping helps you to achive "cleanness" and love of home.
Keep all the families clean,, build a reputation for housekeeping, provide adequate services, and ensure cleanliness of home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is magnificent, it will be dim and dull if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it shine, and so is life
Only by doing it with heart can we succeed. We are serious about shaping exquisiteness with care.
Give me a chance, which will make you satisfied. Quality explains everything,  our professional deserves to be trsted, your recognition is the encouragement!
It's hard for all walks of life!
But I always believe that as long as I'm serious, persistent and hard-working, I'll be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
The plan of a day is to start in the morning. All the good things start in the morning. I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good wishes. Keep a good mood all day. Good morning.
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I reached it; when I matured, I found that happiness was a state of mind, and I was happy when I understood it.
Be the truest and kindest yourself, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, go your own way; There are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, keeping them till the old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Very often, what binds you is not the ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, you'd better face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you rise to difficulties, the problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators jointly hold the first Saudi Arabian Biennial of Contemporary Art-Xinhuanet
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) ( Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennale-Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on November 11 in the JAX district in Diriyah, northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is co-curated by the Saudi Arabian Dirier Biennale Foundation and the ChinaUCCA Yurens Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Feiyu, Curator of the ChinaUCCA Yurens Center for Contemporary Art, as the Art Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "Touching the Stones and Crossing the River", which metaphorizes the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
Covering an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the Biennale spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: Feeling the Stone and Crossing the River, Inheritance as an Experiment, Marginal Thinking, Going to the Public, Beautiful New World and On the Spirit of Art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation arts and performing arts. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention. Some artists used recycled materials in novel ways. For example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in the "Endless Pictures of Rivers and Mountains behind Stories Series" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Dirieh Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that the Biennale will establish an international dialogue so that global audiences can have an opportunity to understand the thriving cultural industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia and strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said, "The Biennale aims to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the Biennial Opening Week, and artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and Standardize the Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts-Xinhuanet
KUNMING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua News Agency/  Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment assistance for the population lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare job management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan Province, at present, a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs have been developed in Yunnan for the employment of rural poor groups such as the labor force lifted out of poverty, which plays an important role in helping the people lifted out of poverty to increase employment and income, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving various rural public service capabilities.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, Rural Revitalization Bureau and Finance Bureau, which mainly standardizes the target scope, fund management, post development and post management of grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare posts.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations are clear, and are set according to the principles of "setting posts as needed, appointing personnel based on posts, dynamic management, total amount control", "whoever develops, whoever uses, who is responsible" and "one post for one person, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment procedure must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training and post arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that each rural public welfare post development department shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the resettled personnel of rural public welfare posts; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.
Wrong address
Hello
Can you cancel your order?
I re-order
Has it been cancelled
Although the rightists had succeeded in history,but not for a long time,because they became greedy when they got small benefits；The more they got,the more they wanted,and once they were attacked, they didn't know where they should go.
But to be honest, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied from the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
III. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much. Because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his theory of anti-communism. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourth，changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make money from political speculation are not Rightists, but bastards.
Let's talk about left.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
Five，recently, I saw some friends refuting the leftists while resisting the anti thief, and they were quite angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and leftists. They are both unreasonable.
Do not try to prove that we are right, let alone let the rebels and leftists admit it, why bother？
I tell my friends : when the rebels call you toadies, when the leftists call you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is the right one!
Many people have dreams when they are teenagers. When they grow old, they forget or pursue dreams, but become paranoid.
He had gone far away from his ideal,and even, the past dragon slaughterer eventually became the evil dragon.
As far as I'm concerned, "left and right" generally refers to "constraint" and "freedom". In China, the innate genes of history and culture lead to a left-sided situation.
Domestic rightists are free, focusing on efficiency and development, while leftists are more regulated, focusing more on equity and security.
At present, the society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States compete with each other. It is certain that the left side will last for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'll just like it.
Don't say anything,Hua Hua is such a loyal friend
In the past two years, America's blockade and containment of Huawei chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The American empire suppressed China's chip industry and required its own enterprises and related enterprises of its allies to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in reduced R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of automobile enterprises and the price rise of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", tech giants in more and more countries have begun to "de-Americanized".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently made frequent moves to host the "Chip Summit". It has also invited 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support local technology giants in the United States. For example, Intel, a time-honored technology giant of the United States, invested USD 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened chip OEM business to the outside world in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field.
When most people think that Intel's move will have some impact on TSMC and is likely to take TSMC's "job".
The reason why they are so sure is that,as a long-established technology giant of the American empire, Intel has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserves. It will definitely rise rapidly in a short time and defeat TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou spoke surprisingly. Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly that it was quite ironic for Intel to build a wafer factory.
Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer space because Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge against TSMC and Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of American Empire's manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world and the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips have been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured, packaged and tested by a factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model made some small enterprises unable to bear the heavy burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to face the huge cost of production line construction, they could only flinch.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to work together in the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he believed that since there was a company specializing in chip design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongmou's vision came true and TSMC came into being.
TSMC's main business is aimed at the single link of "wafer processing". It does not design but only provides OEM services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously regarded itself very highly, looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down  on the wafer fabrication service at that time.
No one could imagine that  the giant who looked down upon the wafer manufacturing service in the past would also start to  work as a foundry now.
So, Zhang Zhongmou feels ironic about Intel's entry into wafer foundry.
TSMC's market capitalisation has now surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with the strong attack of TSMC, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards a 3nm chip, while Intel remains at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
No more waiting
By 19:06 it's been 2 hours since the order was placed 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [strange trending topics].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three trending topics:the Longtaitou Festival  on the second day of the second month, the price rise of Orion,and the Huolala incident. The public opinion spread and formes a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally disappeared. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look exactly the same as the [network public opinion evolution model] shown on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six trending topics from the same event are randomly selected, showing [isolated shape], [jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Isolated peak] refers to people hype things purposely,which quickly rushes to the trending topic list and attracts public attention;[jagged shape] refers to hype events periodicly, which ensures that the topic is on the trending topic list;  [cliff shape] refers to collective evacuation, that is, the  trending topic succeeds playing its "role" , receives new tasks and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is  not a minute difference. It must be that a unified group of online supporters receive the mission and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of Gangsterdom PR is evident: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time,which to attract attention,  which are responsible for science popularization, which arouse controversies, which divert attention, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions and which coerce decisions.The  gangsterdom accounts carry out fine operations in batches and nodes, almost considering all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Apart from all subjective factors such as position and emotion, gangsterdom public relations will have nowhere to hide from objective data alone.
Everything will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

First case of infection with Omicron strain found in Mauritius and other countries-Xinhuanet
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency reports from overseas: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the SARS-CoV-2 variant virus.
Mauritius first reported two cases of infection with the Omicron strain in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; another infected person was a local resident of Mauritius. After contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa, he tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30.
After quarantine treatment in the hospital, the two infected persons turned negative in nucleic acid test results and have returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three of them were students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized due to mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Cypriot government had continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and above arriving by plane are required to take a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Cypriot also announced on the 10th that it would begin vaccinating children  aged 5 to 11 in the country  with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi Health MinisterKhumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country first detected three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
Genomic sequencing of 12 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 by the country's health authorities revealed these 3 cases of infection.

At first, I was introduced by my friend. Because of trust, I chose to have a look. At first, my budget was RMB 70,000 for basic decoration.
When I came to the store, they started  a series of tricks.
The first time I came to the shop, I just showed them my apartment layout.They didn't go to the site to measure the house. But they  could actually give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be decorated within 70,000 yuan.They roughly showed me their materials but I didn't know what brand of materials they used.
Their second scam is that the moment you  arrive at the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit( and once this money is paid you are never refunded unless you have enough experience to try argument with them).
When I'm hesitating to pay the deposit, they'll invite their so-called managers to tell you how much discount you'll get if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being deceived. When I am impulsive, I pay more than 10,000 yuan as a deposit.
There are a lot of questions about their quote. 70,000 yuan doesn't include the reconstruction of water and electricity, nor any door or bathroom, and  these three parts accounting the biggest part of the basic decoration.
Excluding these,their service fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and was told to sign the contract at the beginning without any clear explanation.
When I went to the store for a refund they acted like they were very experienced and had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
No matter what, they would insist that it was the customer's problem and they were not responsible for it at all.
They have all kinds of excuses and there are many details. I don't want to tell you one by one . All in all, don't choose them, because the quality of the house that my friend found them to decorate is also not good, and they tried their best to let you pay all kinds of fees later.
It's a pitfall completely.They are originally fradulent Longtou Decoration, now they become Damei Decoration.It seems that they can change again when they close down the store.
So don't choose a decoration company like this.
In the future, when you choose decoration company, you can search on Baidu frequently and counsult ofen because decoration is not cheap.

Isn't there any other way? For example, how about changing the address?
Okay, so don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, you'll be held accountable.
I asked if I could cancel it in less than 15 minutes

Starry Sky Date丨The Geminid Meteor Welcomes Great Shower on the 14th  -Xinhuanet
TIANJIN, Dec. 12 (Xinhua/Zhou Runjian)-As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be extremely great on December 14. People who like meteor showers can observe it at midnight.
Gemini meteor shower shot by Beijing astronomer An Jiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor shower's parent bodies are periodic comets, but the Gemini shower's parent body is the  asteroid (3200) Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not "bred" by comets.
Xiu Lipeng, a council member of the Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert in astronomy science popularization, said that, just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability. It is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and Perseid meteor shower.
A remarkable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroids, the rich colors,and the number of fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
Gemini meteor shower shot by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will take place around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions).
Gemini meteor shower recommendation index map.
"Last year, the 'colorful' Gemini meteor shower impressed people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the level of excitement will be reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the phase of the moon is the surplus-convex moon, the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the second half of the night, but pay attention to keep warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities. Instead, you can choose a place with high altitude, small light damage and wide vision facing northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon falls and observe visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower in all directions is large, so there is no need to keep an eye on the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower during observation.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower', you'd better choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens with a high ISO and maximum aperture.
For stability and continuity, tripods, backup batteries and shutter wires are also essential."
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned in the topic should refer to LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs in the world have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CEC's forecast, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is less.
Ophthalmologists from CISI Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparative test of people watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye-protection properties and even improve in certain aspects.
At present, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current price of laser TVs on the market is mostly above RMB 10,000. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can realize a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
Plus lower heat generation, less wear and tear on equipment, and longer TV life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high definition image quality, artificial intelligence system and bionic screen, which can bring users more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a pseudo demand, but a product of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not a dish for audio and video players. If they want to take into account the large screen and insufficient viewing environment, they can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing, they can judge by themselves, afraid of listening to what they say.
Briefly, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projectors, laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which is not the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the Fresnel curtain with microstructure is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be changed to 65 inches liquid crystal.
In addition, I especially hate that projection manufacturers take diffuse reflection as a selling point. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen by the eyes is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse reflection on the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. If you want to be more serious, the LCD TV is also diffuse "direct light". If you open the TV ceiling, it will also be illuminated.
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it cannot be imaged at all.
Ignoring the hot-spot (spot) effect of the high-gain curtain, it is really uncomfortable that a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at an angle.

After adding the WeChat and appoint date, the girl sent me the available time, and she replied in time.
I had gone to the store and saw the works, pictures are mostly about outdoor wedding,which are very beautiful and involves many shooting styles.
I briefly exchanged my ideas with a girl after arriving there, she was patient to help me to try two set of clothes that I was uncertain,and finnaly I made the decision and started to makeup. Before shooting, the photographer put some props, guided the movements, and refined on many details.
However, because I didn't communicate with him about the specific shooting ideas, the shooting style was not what I wanted, but it should be beautiful.🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer will help to select photos and communicate the post-production style. I feel quite careful.
It will take about half a month to retouch pictures and wait for the effect~
The second time I won the photo-type Overlord Dinner~ Most of the clothes in the store can I choose one piece for shooting.
Finally, I chose a black gauze dress to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours,makeup and shooting included.  the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother of the post-95s generation.I feel he is still a green hand. I hope he can give more suggestions on customer shooting action guidance in the future.He is quite talkative and the shooting process is relatively pleasant.

It's on the homepage. Come and see Queenie.
When you come to the store,  you fill in your name and phone number first, and then choose your wedding dress. Shop assistants are quite patient to accompany you to change three or four sets of clothes. After choosing the wedding dress, I started to make up and it took much time,and their attitude is good. When shooting, the  photographer would teach you how to pose. But, my face is so big in those pictures. It was supposed to be half a month to retouch pictures, but they sent me pictures only theree or four days. It seems that there is  no difference from the original pictures.
[Environment] The overall situation is good.
There are many clothes available.
There are almost three places for makeup,and the photostudio is inside.
[Service] Very warm and careful.
Stylists are very patient.
The photographer will also be very careful to teach you the pose.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to reshoot.
【Experience】 Maybe the shape is a bit too much, the original double eyelid was pasted with the third eyelid.
The end of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for the daily non-drawn eyebrows.
The photos were given in ten days, but the final effect was not very satisfactory,and I felt that the double-eyelid stickers  were still obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets, but I chose the black dress finally. The lady said that this set was more Hepburn vintage style
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up and hairdressing. The hairdressers and makeup artists were super patient. I wa very satisfied with the effect.
After finishing my makeup and hair, I began to take photos. The photographer commanded me to pose all the time. The process was easy and harmonious.
After the shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorites to be a refiner. The young man said that the film was finished within 15 days, and the ending was very satisfied.
No reply for 3 days... I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan because your system cannot identify my credit card!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay the freight every time
You can waive it first, and then charge me my monthly fee after your investigation. Is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance in xiaoyusan.com?
Xiaoyushan is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the Provisions on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (2015 Amendment) tips,  three keywords must be met  to become an insurance brokerage company:shareholders and sponsors who have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC.
The three rules are harsh. To sum up, insurance companies need to be competent, approved by the national authorities of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country) and have a good style of work. As insurance brokers, insurance applicants don't need to question whether the umbrella insurance is formal. After all, not all insurance companies can meet the three thresholds.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies sell their star critical illness insurance on this platform. For example, the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance, both the claim settler and the underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance. Xiaoyusan Insurance is only a third-party agency, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment model, the products of the Internet platform are generally cost-effective because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the salary cost of salespersons. Moreover, the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of insurance applicants and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of the professionalism of salesmen, this is particularly important because insurance is an industry with very high professionalism requirements. Many Internet product customers can buy insurance by themselves, which has many misunderstandings. In terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when buying insurance and feel that they are healthy or conform to the requirements, which is easy to have many hidden dangers of claim settlement and may be rejected.
I once did insurance telemarketing in "Tencent WeSure" (like Xiaoyuguan, also an online insurance brokerage platform) and told everyone very responsiblely.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, and the unreliable is people. There are no professional practitioners in internet channels, and there are also many sales misleading.
For example, RMB 1 for insurance of RMB 6 million, free mobile phones for buying insurance, and free sum insured for critical illness of RMB 60,000. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid the serious ones and will not tell the policy holder. The first month is RMB 1, and the next month is charged according to the normal rate, ranging from dozens to RMB 200. Many customers do not know what they buy for one or two years.
I thought I could spend $1 and the insurance company would pay 6 million.（pennies from the heaven）
Free mobile phones are given only for special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If a winning short message is sent,  you do not redeem it and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for insurance applicants.) It is a short-term free sum insured for critical illnesses of 60,000 yuan. If you rely only on this and there is no other commercial insurance, what can you do if you really have a critical illness? If the problem cannot be solved, your future life will start running naked.
At present, the state is cracking down on the misleading of online insurance sales.
On the whole, there is no problem with platforms and products. The problem lies in the professionalism and professional ethics of salespersons.
It is suggested that the topic should be considered carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers cover offline products, saving RMB 2,000-3,000/year for each person.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
I: Minya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on their needs. During insurance, I will shop around for customers and try my best to obtain the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will sort out and trust insurance policies for customers, so that customers can be assured.
Grow with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the thread starter！
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, online insurance means that insurance applicants can independently complete all insurance processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policy holder and the insurance consultant do not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policy holder itself.
Although there is no "sense of ceremony" in the application of internet insurance, and there may even be no printed contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model, somewhat similar to the "telemarketing" general assembly line, but buying insurance like this also has a fatal problem, that is -- subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us many years later?

Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone such physical attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you have to resist first.
I've taken a non-responsive attitude since you started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting funny posts, and then trying to post my home location and father's name on social media.
You're not just going to tag me at the rate of six meals a day, but you're going to talk to your so-called friends on Facebook about my privacy, humiliating remarks about my appearance and figure, holding that I am easy to be pregnant, and talking about love bite in bed, whether to insert or not, and I...ignore.
But then I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and comments of sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After the news that I called the police was uploaded, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, or what status you are. In our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue this ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, insulting remark, you can also continue to say that you just care and follow me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yeah, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there's a girl who's willing to let others humiliate herself so much to become famous.
My friend asked me if I was okay.
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice naturally inhabits man's heart
I give you some screenshots that you can comment
Your own posting should not be able to be impersonated
I can only say that you are a civilized public enemy

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet attends the 3rd Vietnam National Forum on Digital Technology Enterprise Development
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two main meetings were held to discuss the two themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and COVID-19 and post-pandemic economic recovery and development.
Minister of Communication and Media Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, the number of digital technology enterprises and business revenue of Vietnam will keep growing momentum of nearly 10% despite the spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated to focus on solving the major problems facing Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Nguyen Manh Hung called on digital technology companies to shoulder responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms, and to take on the task of developing these national digital platforms is to take on a national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared various breakthrough ideas and solutions to mobilize and pool resources from the whole society to develop Vietnam's technology enterprises, jointly promote the national digital transformation, and Zhu Hui's economic recovery after the epidemic.
In his speech at the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet stressed that digital transformation is the way to go in the world and is an objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem. Digital transformation serves all people, so it is necessary to mobilize all people to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for people and businesses.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Jung emphasized that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit and needs to be dominated by internal forces, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, with external forces as important and breakthroughs.
He also believed that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 prevention and control, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and help green transformation and development of green energy.
Digital transformation requires participating in the establishment of databases to protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, etc., and promoting digital transformation in the fields of banking, taxation, land management and development databases and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country increasingly prosperous.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet called for greater leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology at all levels of government, agencies and enterprises, raising awareness of digital transformation, continuing to develop and improve institutions on digital transformation, strengthening national management and promoting the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respect, communication, listening, proactivity and initiative.
During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Triet attended the award ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Outstanding Digital Product Award 2021 and the opening ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.

U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China  Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17  Multidimensional Pro-CCP Media Multidimensional Report:China-U.S. Relations Update: The latest satellite image shows that three United States aircraft carriers are gathering around China. The U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the United States naval arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending important signals to allies and adversaries of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a think tank in China, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait on January 9.
The Balabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea,is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Ospreys.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on 3 January, is now on the Pacific Ocean.
For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carries a squadron of F-35Cs, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the above two carriers, the United States Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region on the USS Ronald Reagan docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier strike group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stokdal.

Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "thunder submarines" in the United States naval fleet are generally kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine the "most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad", a system that also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located in the continental United States and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
I was talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% plunge and $251 billion market value evaporation.  Zuckerberg responded to why [facing unprecedented competition].
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising company has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever the functional orientation, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Moreover, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps connect to Meta's advertising, and realizable value can be attained through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt users whether to allow Apps to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reactions are definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google makes another move, it would have a greater impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the China factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
As we all know, Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by companies engaged in overseas business in China.
Meta has around a few hundred people in its offices in Hong Kong and several agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they invested is given to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance two years ago.
Domestic agencies are helping ByteDance advertise on Meta, and Meta Greater China also performs well.
I don't know much about it recently, but it's definitely not as good as before.
The stage of massive cash-burning overseas by Chinese companies has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not just about income, but more importantly about future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are insufficient.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg said, "The metaverse."
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of meta in the past two to three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta will have a tough time.
Although Facebook enjoys reputation now and has a huge  revenue of USD 100bn-200bn every year, it has a strong sense of crisis. Compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies, Facebook has no good security barrier.
Although some of its social apps, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, have high DAUs, Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok. Subversion can happen between the blink of an eye.
The metaverse is an unreachable concept, and there is no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong and it is a non-return path. The above is my thoughts for reference.
