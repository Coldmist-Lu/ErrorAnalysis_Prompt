Students sing the lead role at the zhejiang university academic annual conference The research results make people's minds open - Xinhua Net
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with a breath, and accurately search for the source of smog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, the research covers the environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students from a curious idea, created a lot of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your family medical examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the smart phone side, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You only need to take a light breath, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of your body from the gas components you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, which targets chemical elements and a keen sense of smell that allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: High-energy eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland, this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lamp used in the doctor's operating room. ”
Shen Junfei said that for example, in the early examination of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp plates that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and imagelessness of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just by standing on the handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air, which forms a fluid at the tap, is combined with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands! ”
Color development reactions and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of washing, but also save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Challenges Summit, the invention stood out from many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I find very meaningful – a first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I feel are important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time in the process of ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, a respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, four minutes of gold!
So the people around you understand how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is too frightening.
"In China, our official data counts three million accidental deaths each year, the most dangerous of which is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In las Vegas casino hotels, 70% or 80% can be saved, shanghai, Beijing less than 1%. ”
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, the breathing is gone, the heartbeat is gone, there is no effect on you pinching the person.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be done to save people.
I find that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid now, but it is too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing unexpected situations.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal I want to complete before the age of 25, and adding the first aid card to the target list is also a few months ago, but it is indeed completed!
Then to go to the exam other want to test the certificate, plan to go to the test of a diving certificate, before in the little red book to see that there is a diving first aid certificate, the test of this certificate seems to have to have a first aid certificate to go to the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

First of all, the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say that this movie is not a highlight or not, it is not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad films, so that you can sleep soundly in the cinema is counted as one, so that you can be indignant after watching it is also a kind of one, "Four Seas" to the audience is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a Croat novel, inexplicable, and full of loopholes like a trench coat on the little mago.
Even after watching it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of.
Let's start with some of the plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he and his grandmother are dependent on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people riding a van to watch the snow from the south to the northeast??
He and his dad were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was gone.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and his brother get a business license?
Why can the island biker party gangsters easily seal a section of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering the reinforcement in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop sense is also too obvious.
Why would a small flying car party that is not good at credit and suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharking, why don't you call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room door for a night?
This inexplicable plot pervades the film, and because the plot is so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main theme of the movie, or the theme of the movie at all, is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, after more than 20 minutes you guess it may be an inspirational film, half of the time you think it may be a drama film that wants to reflect the difficult survival of small-town youth, after watching it, you don't know what you are watching, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why do you want to run to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you honestly talk about the feud between the small town youth who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waiter girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot can't come up with something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng has just been burned, and then can still sing), can not go to some of the kennedy can not be bothered to see the brain hole.
As for the heroine who is obviously not mentally retarded, she can act like a 5-year-old child in some ways, I really don't know if this is the reason for the acting or the director's requirements.
Another point I can't understand, why is Han Han so keen to add a crash plot to his own movies as a racing driver?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival stall to add to the blockage of the audience?

South African doctor: Although the transmissibility of Aomi Kerong is strong, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus Omilton variant is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
As the Aumechjong variant spreads in South Africa, an organization of more than five thousand doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of covid-19 patients they are currently treating are mild, such as body aches and coughs, similar to the flu, according to the Associated Press.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none need to be hospitalized yet.
Pillay said: "They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation . ”
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, which would otherwise be more likely to be severely ill from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people are hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omiljung mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, which is half the proportion of severe diseases in the previous wave; The average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared with 20% of deaths in early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cites data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease . ”
He also said: "It's still early, and we need to get the data later.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we enter this wave of outbreaks for only two weeks. ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of COVID-19, cases of Omiljung are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Gauteng in the first week of December increased by 400 percent, and tests showed that the Omiljung variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy to the famous public service slogan "No sale, no killing", then, in a good environment without the demand for "abduction", mass prevention and mass governance and the whole people's anti-abduction make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children developed by the Anti-Abduction Office.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children and to recover abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I feel warm and warm.
The new technology means are not only called "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also use information properly, practically and effectively.
The primary goal of cracking down on abduction and law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, until the abduction and trafficking case is broken, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help", topics such as "whether the abduction and trafficking of children should be executed all the time" can be put aside and discussed cautiously; But the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they have succeeded.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one minute, the child may be one step away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "reunion" platform that directly help to solve the case and find the child.
After all, "cracking down on abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
Cracking down on crime and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the meticulousness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, and the parents were asleep, and they woke up to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Two parents taking turns resting, or keeping their children under safe protection, are the minimum means of preventing children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police crackdown on trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single wrongdoer is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Provisions of our Criminal Code, the statutory penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; If the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the confiscation of property shall be imposed.
With a high starting point and a maximum punishment, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishments under the general trend of "light punishment".
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and have a weak sense of law.
The legal education of this group of people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" for abduction and trafficking exists extensively, and the traffickers are eager for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, and form a "fighting method" situation with law enforcers, the anti-abduction operation is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and bribery of children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at Malanshan Mountain
Draw the strength to forge ahead from the party's century-old history of struggle

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two broad categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is an oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing, filtering and other treatments to remove foreign matter.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest grade and highest quality olive oil, it is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a light and pleasant plant aroma, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin: Slightly more acidic, but not more than 2%, with a pure, aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile taste and color, and its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is a transparent pale golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil obtained by dissolving and refining the oil residue.
If you have seen the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like a grape that makes wine, olive fruit from different appellations, different olive fruit varieties, will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best places to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions such as soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for olive oil growth.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be cultivated sporadically in suitable areas.
Main regions of origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and its climate is similar to argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on in the southern latitudes.
Olive harvest months:
From March to June of each year, it is the time for the olive tree to flower and set fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple and finally black.
From November to February, the fruit is picked (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional facts of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.

The democracy summit came to an end, and Biden said the flame of freedom would never be extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world and leaders of civil society and the private sector, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold a second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Guan-chung, who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because I have said before that, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the faint fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. ”
Speaking to the summit via pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Guancong reminded participants of their continued attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and among Ethnic Chinese minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has been subject to China's rise without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. ”
Mr. Law also called on the free world to unite against the CCP's threat.
"Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change . ”
Tang Feng, a political councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a "National Declaration" via video during a roundtable discussion on "Cracking Down on Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in how to combat COVID-19 through transparency and building trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in its infancy, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy is showing signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down the shelves to defeat false information. ”
At the same time as the second day of the Democracy Summit, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which have been found to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance techniques to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the slobbering chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, then the normal situation of expensive will be friendly than cheap beats, this kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot stand up, and the master is difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that ——— tennis is so difficult, I know that you can't learn it, and I know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you will not play again, so that this beat is cheap, and you are not distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it shows that you have improved, and when the time comes to come to me to buy expensive ones, I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets can not sell the price, the new 500, 600 is very good, the second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan beat of the enjoyment is not fragrant?
It is very friendly to novices, but once it passes the novice stage, it is chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed several times

The girl collects donations for her sister as an arrow target: "It's okay to think that it is a flesh and skin injury" - Xinhua Net
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girls willing to be 'arrow targets' to raise donations for her sister" burst the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person, and the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after payment.
This behavior has aroused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move to collect donations for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating, and after warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls were warned of "arrow target" fundraising on the street
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "one", and the wooden board is written with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" in black ink, and the other wooden board in front of her is written with her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay account number, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "begging behavior of bo eyeballs", and many netizens express sympathy for this.
"We found out when we patrolled to the side of the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers at that time. ”
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed up young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who does the "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl was on the side to help shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery, please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was collecting donations for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still requires more than 300,000 costs, it is impossible to think of a good way to raise donations, so this behavior has been made.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was a target, and one was responsible for laying hands, but they did not participate in it, and no one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone watched and took a photo and posted it on Weibo.
Later, the police were identified by the Public Security Department as using bows and arrows that were not regulated.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eyeball fundraising method is not recommended."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.

What's hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The project manager can impact the gold medal olympic project" article is very hot, which mentions that the project managers in many projects, absolutely can take the lead, no one can match: moving bricks, traveling, staying up late is the daily life of the project manager, fire fighting, back pot, apology is not a word.
An article that seems to be a joke, but it also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, and behind it represents the inability to do the current project management work.
The personnel engaged in project management work have gradually chosen to get themselves out of the predicament at work through some actions.
Judging from the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) enrollments that climb every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Report on the Twenty-Year Development of China Project Management (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of effective holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP licensees has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing working environment lets us know that there is a way to learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the relevant knowledge points such as the ten major areas of project management and the five major process groups, but when the project management work is really carried out, it is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not be landed, project estimates are not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed again and again; The division of labor among the members is not clear, the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with the cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, with the "R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course.

On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, China's residents have a better performance at the level of financial consumption, but they reflect great differences in different financial behaviors and skills, and they need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen released the "China Youth Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance released the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" shows that the young generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of the people have no debt accumulation, although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the "excessive squandering" label labeled by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend consumption behavior. And thus generated excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility, positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and intimate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct concept of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' rational consumption awareness, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumer needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay the loan on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life of buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily - GCC addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a sweeping embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by both countries.
The Gulf Arab States resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar out of a demand that must be united for the interests of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate mobility and integrated supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to save the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — an agreement condemned by gulf Arab states for arguing that they could not resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that there is a flaw in not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has negotiated directly with Iran against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers to meet the wishes of the Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first GCC summit since some members ended their dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in meeting common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Good
Known as the New Mountain Super Run exhaust sound is the loudest!
This time our team brought you this car, which is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement of the Murcielago — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million, the annual road tax is more than ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
That even if you don't know, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably xiaobian's myvi to 30km/h when people will reach 100km/h, well.
The low bodywork, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes that surround the body and the 6.5 v12 engine with unobstructed view under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
For the car description does not need to say too much, their own Google is good, Xiaobian sorted out some Google does not necessarily give to the explanation!
Too much attention, everywhere everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a bit cool)
1km oil money around RM1 (owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a little awkward (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's still cool)
The body is too large, the parking space will be very narrow, and I am afraid of being knocked on when the car next door opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of Supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!
For more information about cars you didn't know about, it's in The Car Guide
A car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that car owners know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the porsche 911 is also priced in millions!
Before that day, foreign countries knocked out a million sports cars in just a few minutes 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron!
Look at the results, you are reasonable!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times on the same frequency - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits accumulated by a university in the process of development for a long time, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological, social development, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations, for China's universities, arising in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply affected by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde Ji Shi, Xiu Qi Zhi Ping" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating the country with learning".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent competition is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Comprehensively Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's most popular in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking in curves"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; The second is cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past 5,000 years, and carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and enhance image; The third is institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, pooling consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catch-up and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that the construction of a world-class university cannot be a thousand schools, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal positioning, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running the school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and combines school and enterprise, and forms a whole-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary disciplines, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and landmark cross-cutting achievements; The third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang university-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Moral Cultivation, Discernment and Solidity" and "Haina River, Qizhen Houde, Pioneering People, and Building Our Country" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents are used by me", and is expressed as the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous schools; "Qi Zhen HouDe" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and being kind, which refers to the fact that while pursuing the truth, universities should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the improvement of personality; "Pioneering the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the innovation of knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, but also the reform and development, the revolution of the old and the new; "Building Our Nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication and talks about the fact that universities should always share the glory and disgrace of the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission shouldered by the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation can stir each other, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

At the time when the NFT was rapidly out of the circle, a new concept emerged from the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic have begun to earn a steady income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet cultivation game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of gameplay including NFTs, and is currently the highest-traded NFT project, with more than $3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to "Glory of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will pass on a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to the fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise in the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first of all, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least more than 100 billion market size; Secondly, it is necessary to choose industries with good future growth and consider industries in which the industry growth reaches the best state in the next 3-5 years; Finally, it is necessary to choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which is to get things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen or extend horizontally in the current field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new; On top of the dau (tactical thinking), it is possible to consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, el Salvador, a small Central American country, made bitcoin legal tender, the first time bitcoin has become legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the U.S. capital market, expanding its exposure to cryptocurrency investments again.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting that three famous Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College —discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian-American Education Coalition, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American universities has doubled, but in these 3 american universities, the proportion of Asians has remained basically at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three colleges and universities, Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
The U.S. Department of Education data also shows that Brown and Dartmouth Have the lowest percentage of Asian-American students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have imposed de facto racial quotas on Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they hope that after filing the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained colleges and universities to take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the 3 universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian American Education Coalition complained about harvard admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the complaint also included Indian American, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory building in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, After consulting with lin mou, the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as a payee on the "Deposit Receipt for The Sale and Purchase of Factory Buildings", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, the deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the two parties agree to sign the plant sale and purchase contract within one week." ”
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the factory building and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It is not easy to see the house, the deposit is paid, the house payment is also ready, it is almost "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, but the seller does not sell, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract in the end could not be attributed solely to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed that the consultation could not be completed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer reminds】 In the process of transaction, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary duty of care.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise the necessary duty of care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by others, etc., and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
Chinese After the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw a line with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatism and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', resulting in disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long since become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere with other countries.
The summit is Biden's act of delivering on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held by video and was attended by 111 world leaders, including The leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the grounds that there were problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to preside over such a summit.
There were also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, such as criticism that some of the leaders invited to the meeting including some authoritarian tendencies, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubted that the Biden administration's real intention was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholts also attended the Video Democracy Summit
China's Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is full of pathologies, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party antagonism, political polarization, social rift, racial contradictions, and the division between the rich and the poor are intensifying."
In his remarks, U.S. President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the power of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good." "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in every generation, and in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time." "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need to be defended by fighters in the face of ongoing and worrisome challenges."
The U.S. side pledged a year-long initiative after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news outlets.
The United States expects countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of the entity democracy summit planned for late 2022.
Biden said, "Let's all of us deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year."

Educational Thinking: How College Examinations Can Make "Academic Bullies" and "Scum of Learning" Get Their Own Places - Xinhua Net
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, and let the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic."
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of ability, coupled with varying levels of learning.
For the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings.
Of course, if the test question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not use work may be able to pass the pre-exam concentrated assault, and if they think of other methods, it is possible to achieve the effect of doubling the results with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "scum" who can pass the pass without investing in it, and even get a high score; "Xueba" usually never falls behind, the homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems existing in the university examination are not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not only the existence of Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these 3 students who wrote straight letters.
In fact, people who have gone to college know very well that it is not uncommon to surprisely prepare for the exam, think of various ways to "take" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and seek "key counseling" before the exam, and even the situation of carrying a small copy in the exam and asking the teacher to raise his noble hand after the exam is not a strange thing.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, the measure of whether a university examination is passed or not lies in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to subdivide, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether or not to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, from the knowledge point, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As some teachers have said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned, and it is still the focus." ”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will coordinate the composition of the examination paper, and the examination paper will also be participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the duplication of the examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, to draw up a set of test questions that meet the actual teaching and learning, the topics are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time innovate the design of the question type.
Examinations are the baton of university education, what kind of examinations, students will have a corresponding preparation plan, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the students' letter of recommendation, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examinations of course completion examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of single type of test questions, repeated questions and other issues is the university examination need to face the topic, of course, the need to introduce the corresponding system, but the kung fu is expensive in daily life, the teacher needs to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student's learning situation, the two ends of the thorough, teaching and learning will be better docked, the formation of benign interaction, the examination will be more realistic, so that the "learning bully" and "scum" each have their place.
If I can't change the location of my branch for me, can I change it to delivery?

The photographer is also very humorous and feels very happy after taking pictures for a day.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I was reluctant to let guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, there was no intention of letting us add photos, 24 photos in the direct package, one did not add (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time, more than 7,000 packages also added more than 10,000 photos, at that time I was stunned, and I was afraid that I would choose too much)
Today the photo was fixed, Lanlan sent it to me, I saw two of them and felt that it was not very good, they immediately helped me to repair it again.
Turning over the photos of my sister before and comparing them, I think our photos are really satisfied, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah were out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu 11) The Sabah National Register said that since the beginning of October, it has not been possible to issue birth paper to newborn babies because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper has been depleted, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kairouaminus, assured that all babies who have applied for raw paper have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-long report by an online media outlet that had been printing paper for newspapers in Sabah.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers that produce special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China. ”
He explained that sabah newspaper used different security paper than other regions and therefore could not be borrowed from other states.
Kairouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah and immediately carry out the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will take 2 more working days (December 20) to hand over to the applicants." ”
"We will notify applicants to go to local sub-bureaus to collect the newspaper paper. ”
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.

Isn't that almost there?

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling for strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities - Xinhua Net
Beijing, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring those who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to land border port cities to conduct nucleic acid testing at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones in their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there are frequent exchanges between border people on both sides.
The implementation of the differentiated management policy of zoning, from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to move the threshold forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, a number of local clusters of epidemics have occurred in China, all of which are imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed the problems of untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some places, the closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the sanitize of all links of cold chain goods, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the emergency handling of the epidemic situation is not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made from 9 aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, we will accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of the prevention and control of port cities, do a good job in prevention and control work without relaxation, science and precision, and weave a tight defense line against external inputs.
The circular emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and the people's livelihood security work simultaneously, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic daily necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to in it include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) where they are located, and the specific scope is determined and announced by each province (autonomous region or municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube video starts at the bottom of the 20 years of bloodthirsty killings of the US military - Xinhua Net
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism" to launch the Afghan war, through the war to forcibly export American democracy, 20 years of military force, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocents, committed a variety of crimes against humanity.
The abuse of drones to air raid civilian places such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and sets up killing squads.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black jail" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have stoked hatred among even more Afghans.
As the video says, the More anti-terrorist "war" in the United States is , the more anti-terrorist " it becomes.
The war has not brought the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and pierce the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
Inadvertently saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help do canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the bagged milk powder and the milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then you will surely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag one year, while the shelf life of the listening package is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so large?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the listening package is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why it is expensive to listen to, where is it expensive?
Why is the difference between their raw materials so large?
Because most manufacturers in the pricing of most of the time to consider that if the bagging pricing is too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, then what do the manufacturers rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of the listening package to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly recommend listening to packaging, not bagging.
And you think so many manufacturers have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising costs every year, where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: the promotion staff of the mall, the display cost of the mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and it is listening to the clothing, and its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulous, linked to the doctors of the hospital, they assist in the promotion of products, from a listen to the inside of the profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such a way of operation, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder into the can under the premise of having a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same as the bag after the bag is opened, it is only that the bag is not easy to preserve after the bag is opened, and it is easy to deteriorate by moisture.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after the cold, it was dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it

Don't scare people down at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, to assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do.— "what."
It is equivalent to saying that it has suddenly crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Because of this, these books all have a common feature —either they do their best in a single blow, or they do nothing at all; Either 100 or 0; Either you climb Mount Taishan, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes anyone look at it and admit that it is "incomparable", but 99% of people will be intimidated by the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, conform to the old ways, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception and a move to play the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "transformation", stagnant, and difficult to make up their minds; Or with a momentary impulse to make a determination to "change" and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are not long, and they can't persist for a while before they lose, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross-talk of "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "sub-good principle" is a way to potentially put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
At the heart of the "sub-good principle" is "lowering the threshold" – it encourages a theory of "small wins become big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, only 1 can do it: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Taishan, just climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because it's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not doing it.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as everything is adhered to, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that following the "sub-good principle" of success is a little longer.
All in all, the "best principle", although ostensibly in the name of making everyone successful, is ultimately able to motivate, in fact, it is still a minority; The "sub-good principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xining, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared with the early stage of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a decisive role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale hunting by humans and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, the naked carp of Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake to breed fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and stocking, cleaning up the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish crossing channels" and other measures to continue to increase protection, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, nearly 180 million naked carps in Qinghai Lake have been artificially increased and stocked, and the contribution rate to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued a notice on the prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

Just saw an article about menstrual leave, it's too long.
Give the male science that does not know about it.
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual leave one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will also turn over (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people have three days, some people have one week; Some people bleed less, some people have a big blood collapse; Some people have no reaction, some people are in pain to the ambulance to transport away, dysmenorrhea will change with time, before no pain does not mean a lifetime of pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end, and all that can be done is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, the physiological period has not had time to eat ibuprofen when there is no time for dysmenorrhea can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to diarrhea.
If you probably reach the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, basically within two days will come to menstruation.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, in addition to sleep time, the worst case is to replace 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 tablets, if you add the portion prepared in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify here, tampons do not have to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, that is, very unlucky, the body to make a trip.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that's flowing, it contains the shedding endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickened, it can be understood that the uterus is the house, every month to build a house (the lining thickens) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, the cycle begins.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, 24 hours a day a month bleeding, but also abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants?
But a man can be born because his mother came to menstruate, menstruation is to prepare you for the first time you come to this world to live in a house for 10 months, everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that was it, but the times changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation behavior made by the female body for the conception of life is disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, don't think so, never experienced, will not experience in this life, do not know much about men, do not be so ungrateful and do not know good, how can this attitude be good to face their mothers, how to want their children?
Finally, the sisters try the tampons, which really work.
Today is the winter solstice festival, and it is disappointing to send the wrong one
Order a separate meal for the children
I hope that the store will check the products when it is busy
Is the foot bath soaking feet numb is a leakage of electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot health care, today Gome Xiaobian will make an answer to this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, the foot bath is more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of different grades of products have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan of foot baths, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking your feet in the water with electricity is so dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father to make a birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he did not expect that the vibration function was turned off, and his father still felt numbness in the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, the pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, and although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this foot bath, which has been popular for a long time, now has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the setting of the maximum temperature, what kind of people are suitable, and what kind of materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, in general, the foot bathtub will not have a live problem, but it is not excluded that a small number of products are not strictly controlled at the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a split foot bath.
Hydropower separation, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take the pen to test it at will.
The opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Nod Notes - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All Media Reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan Correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new impetus into the "colorful Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Xiang, four waters and five colored teas".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, green tea, black tea, black tea and other major teas have taken turns to exert efforts, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase income.
Feng Shui takes turns, and black tea exerts its strength.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded medals to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Black Tea" trademark, and Xinhua praised the "Source of Lake Red".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to an alpine tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic situation and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, injected with the connotation of tea culture, popularity, trading fire, Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I didn't want it, and he couldn't get it because there was no way to park below
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is a fundamental law of philosophy designed to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
Chinese translation of the name "Metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "Metaphysical Is the Way of the Metaphysical, Metaphysical Islamic" in the I Ching Andyo Dictionary, which was translated by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period) from metaphysic.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its extended problems.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existential entities and which nouns represent only a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to the method of study that does not say a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between mind and body."
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct endorsed by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theories or criticisms) and normative ethics (judging various moral concepts and giving suggestions on moral codes for right or wrong behavior).
It studies the style of moral code of conduct that people should follow), applied ethics (the study of applying ethical theories to actual life conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the theory of expectations, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by social groups.)
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: Humanistic Ethical Thought, represented by the likes of Walla and Montaigne.
Part II: The Ethical Thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part III: The Ethics of Politics, Represented by Machiavelli et al., Modern Ethics (17th-18th centuries, British Empiricist Ethics, Representative Figures: Hume et al., 17th-18th Century, Continental Rationalist Ethics, Representative Figures: Spinoza et al., 18th Century, French Enlightenment Ethics, Representative Figures: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th Century, German Academic Ethics, Representative Figures: Kant and Hegel, etc., 18th-19th Century, British Utilitarian Ethics, Representative figures: Bentham and Sikirvik, etc., 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representative figures: Li Kaier, etc., late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is the study of "principles and criteria for effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retrospective reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline based on the study of the nature of beauty and its meaning.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the long period of more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed to my friends at home and abroad in my own name in early 1994.
Today, the vast majority of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to work as families.
It is your act of righteousness that has helped us, the families in distress, through the most difficult times.
The COVID-19 pandemic is raging around the world, and most donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our refugees, the Tiananmen Mothers, which should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye press: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the All-American Self-Government Association (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the ALLA and the Minnesota Foundation for Democracy in China are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often intersect.
(Apple Daily Photo: Tiananmen Mother's website is run by Tao Ye.) ）pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often do not reach the hands of the June Fourth refugees smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June Fourth Orphans and Elderly Special Hardship Household Relief Fund", which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the year of June Fourth, from generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the Families of the June Fourth Disaster finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Chinese Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding's suspension of June Fourth donations is for the sake of donors, and we are indeed some retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement, and we hereby express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the decision of the families to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
We would also like to express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generous and generous for many years and have risked the delivery of humanitarian relief funds.

After opening the box, please check whether the goods are complete.
If there is any defect, please contact customer service in time.
The cover plate on the microfluidic chip is MADE of PC material, and no solvent that reacts chemically with the PC should be introduced.
Do not use a push syringe to inject the chip directly, otherwise it is easy to leak.
Microfluidic chips on the common substrate are tested in pure water at 500mbar (100um channel depth) or 300mbar (50um channel depth) injection pressure before shipment.
The chips of the glass substrate are tested in pure water at the injection pressure of 800mbar (100um channel) before shipment, and you should be careful not to collide with sharp objects during the use of the glass substrate chip, otherwise the substrate will be damaged.
During use, please consider and do not exceed this range in combination with the viscosity of the solution, otherwise it will cause leakage.
Under the condition that the ordinary substrate microfluidic microchip uses pure water injection in the syringe pump, we give you a recommended flow rate setting of less than 150ul/min, and the recommended oil phase flow rate is set below 50ul/min.
Consider the viscosity of the actual injected liquid and increase your flow rate parameter value from slow to fast.

Thank you rabbit for the comments originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style Did not expect the finished product to come out is simply too beautiful
Thanks to Dan Dan's recognition, your satisfaction can make us fully charged and continue to move forward, we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really fantastic Highly recommended for all the little ones!
From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production is impeccable.
Makeup artists are particularly delicate, will match your makeup according to your style, cosmetics are also used in the first line of big brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere and there are two kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing's better studios need to queue up half a year in advance, colleagues have taken in Beijing, watched the next film to feel just so so.
I deliberately sought out this studio, a place with a soul and an attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we think that this is also a short version of most people, and the photographer Liang Ge will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, a sophisticated team.
It came out in a film of praise from us and the people around us.
I have recommended my girlfriend to go over, and my girlfriend has just watched the negative film and is also full of joy.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover it and shoot it out of their own style, rather than being the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling, both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as the customers like us to do our best to complete, grateful to meet each other
Sweet and caring assistant, as well as lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone on the team is super nice a wonderful shooting, a very memorable experience, and the effect of shooting is much better than I imagined, everyone has worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comments Knowing you is also a kind of fate From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust in us is thousands of kilometers away, so much, I am very happy to know you, I have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time

A programming idiot who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is best to learn by yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If your self-control is stronger, you can also choose to teach yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we must look at the teaching staff of this institution, if the teaching force is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing to inquire about this training institution, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is, and the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, the profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will all have something to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or the computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now many offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, two more time to invest, basically need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it is these situations I said, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to the b station also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explains in detail, there are also people who have special answers to questions, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal push quotas, and recommend going to the company after learning, so that the interview link to find a job can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, as mentioned earlier because I do not understand your situation, so only a general introduction is not detailed, if you have other ideas to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said I arrived before 1 o'clock and I saw it in the app

Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it calmly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you face the difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Sino-Saudi curators jointly held Saudi Arabia's first biennial of contemporary art - Xinhua net
Riyadh, 12 Dec (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first biennale of contemporary art, the Diriyer Biennale of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on December 11 at the Diriyer JAX Art District, located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Dirier Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Feiyu Tian, Curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Social and Cultural Development.
Covering an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the biennale spans six interconnected buildings and presents six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going to the Public", "Brave New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art; The work of 12 Chinese artists has also attracted attention, some using recycled materials in novel ways, such as Xu Bing's "Endless Pictures of The Creek And Mountains in the Behind the Story Series" (2014), reconstructing a classic landscape painting with waste.
Buckley, CEO of the Dirier Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that the Biennale will establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community and strengthen interaction.
"The goal of the Biennale is twofold, to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art," Tian said. ”
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the biennial exhibition, where artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts-Xinhua Net
Kunming, December 12 (Xinhua) -- In order to continue to do a good job in helping the people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts for the employment of rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor, which plays an important role in helping the people out of poverty to achieve employment income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations are jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan People's Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly standardize the scope of objects, fund management, post development, and post management of rural public welfare post personnel recruited at the grass-roots level.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations are clear, in accordance with the principles of "setting up posts according to needs, fixing people by posts, dynamic management, total quantity control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and arrangement of induction.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that each rural public welfare post development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the placement personnel of rural public welfare posts; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can you cancel your order
I re-placed my order
Whether it has been canceled
Second, although the rightists have a prosperous era in history, they are not long, so they are short because they give a little sunshine and sweat when they drink some boiling water; If you have a little ambition, you will be able to look at Shu, and if you are hit, you will be attached to Mao.
But realistically speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution in defining the standard of truth, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statement and respect Li Weidong as a person; Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that the anti-essential revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the damage to the people's livelihood, the political group is mixed with mud and sand, and then foreign countries are taking advantage of the situation.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must have a patient and responsible attitude for the country and the people, and those who try to take advantage of the fire in political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left.
Zuo, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right's remarks and analyze their ideas when needed, then the Left will not be created, because what the Left wants is the dross that the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, recently I have seen some friends refuting their left epilepsy while intimidating thieves, and they are still very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to be reasonable with the traitors and zuo yi, they are all a tendon and have no reason to talk about.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about making the anti-thief and the left epileptic admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, when the left scolds your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue ideals, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even the dragon slayer teenager eventually became a dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to constraint and freedom, China from the innate genes of history and culture lead to China as a whole should be on the left.
The domestic right is free and pays attention to efficiency and development, and the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now the society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left side is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'm done with liking
Don't say anything, huahua is such a righteous thing
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei's chips by the US imperialists has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US" enterprises.
The US imperialist suppression of China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises in allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, resulting in a shortage of chip supply chain disorder around the world.
Nowadays, "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", more and more national technology giants have begun to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the control of global semiconductors and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, Lao Mei has recently made frequent moves and hosted the "Chip Summit"; For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel, the veteran technology giant of the United States, spent $20 billion to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened up the chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to steal TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as an established technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, and will surely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, and Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples about Intel's move to build a fab factory: Intel built a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite dismissive of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still grumpy about a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US imperialist manufacturing industry, ranking at the top of the world and being the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was designed, manufactured to be packaged and tested by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred by huge production line construction costs.
Under the inspiration of market demand, after entering the 80s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation, in 1984 Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a special design, then a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a small minion in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once looked for Intel to invest, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did manufacturing in the chip industry, it was obvious that some of them had high self-esteem, looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services now have to start doing wafer foundries.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in the 14nm of 7 years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Wait no more
Orders have been placed for 2 hours 😅 by 19:06
Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February two dragons to raise heads, Good Liyou price increase, goods Lala incident, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, if the secondary public opinion will have a small hump appear again.
They look exactly like the "Model of Internet Public Opinion Evolution" once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is unusual public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing "lone peak-like", "jagged", and "cliff-like".
[Lone peak shape] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search, causing public concern; [Jagged] that is, periodic heating, to ensure that the topic is on the hot search list; [Cliff-like] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search to play a "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad every second, and it must be a unified batch of water troops who receive the task and start a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, which coercive decisions, black industry accounts in batches, nodes and fine operations, almost taking into account all the elements of public opinion dissemination and spread.
Communication is a science, putting aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks by will leave a trace, and such a trace, we will dig it out together.

Damei 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12th floor of Happy Home, No. 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at it At first, my budget was 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
When you come to the store, you start a series of tricks.
I was the first time to the store just showed them my floor plan, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they can actually give me an offer to say that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably show me their materials and do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that you will drag you to pay the deposit as soon as you arrive at the store (and once you pay the money, you will never be able to return it, unless you have enough experience to fight with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much of a discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being deceived, when the mind is impulsive, paid more than 10,000 deposits.
The offer he gave me had a lot of problems 70,000 excluding hydroelectric retrofits, not including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three were the majority of the cost of the base.
In addition to these, their point-of-service fees are also higher than those charged by other companies.
I lost trust in the company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at first.
When I go to them for a refund, they show a very experienced look, with a dedicated small team to deal with you.
In any case, it is the customer's problem that they are completely irresponsible for.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities, there are many details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friends look for them to decorate the house is also of poor quality, the later for you to calculate various costs.
Pit Daddy, they are the original deceptive dragon head decoration, now changed to damei, it seems to have gone out of business and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a bad decoration company.
In the future, when you choose Baidu, look at these check these consultations because decoration is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to a merchant, please log in or register first
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of merchant reviews, please see the merchant inclusion statement for details

Isn't there any other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, then you don't cancel this conversation, if you don't refund me in 5 to 10 days, you must pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes

The starry sky has about 丨 Gemini meteor shower ushered in the great on the 14th - Xinhua Net
Tianjin, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a huge scale on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night after the same day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu photographs the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent bodies of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is Asteroid 3200 Faetong, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "conceived" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteoroid body is slower, colorful, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual vision and beginners in astrophotography.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor shower will be extremely large at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal viewing conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'Falling Colors' Gemini meteor shower made a deep impression, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the excitement will be slightly reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, the moon phase is the full and convex moon, the bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation, fortunately, in the second half of the night the moon will fall, at this time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours after the moon in the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold protection and warmth. ”
How can I observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to make observations in cities, but to choose a place with a high altitude, little light damage, and a wide field of vision facing northeast in the suburbs or in the countryside, and then patiently wait until the moon sets and visually observe."
It should be noted that the Flow of the Gemini Meteor Shower in all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to stare at the radiation points of the Gemini Meteor Shower all the time when observing.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and durability reasons, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TVs focus more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or that laser TVs themselves are products of large-screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of global shipments and sales of laser TVs has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why there are such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly hit the eyeball, compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also smaller.
Experts from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronics Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative tests of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions of the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TVs, the current price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light sources, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small, occupying a small place.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Talk about pseudo demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio and video players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything is pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment, they are afraid to listen to one side of the word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to get close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which did not meet the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel curtains, expensive, 80-inch price can basically be replaced by a 65-inch LIQUID crystal.
There is also a point, I especially hate the projection manufacturer to take diffuse reflection to the eyes as a selling point, please, the eyes can see the light on the curtain is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be more real LCD TV is also a diffuse "direct shot", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not become like it at all.
It is precisely because the heat spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wen photography visual aesthetics photography museum preferred quality store There is no branch at present
Added a WeChat appointment date, the little sister will be available in the time schedule sent to me, reply to the message is more timely ~ ~
Before going there, I saw the shooting works in the store, more outdoor wedding dresses, the shooting is very beautiful, and there are many shooting styles involved.
After arriving on the day, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my sister, very patiently helped me try two sets of styles of clothes that I was entangled in, and finally decided to start makeup styling ~ the photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and strive for excellence in various details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, the shooting was not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photo, exchange the post-production style, and feel very careful.
The repaired film takes about half a month, sit and wait for the effect~
The second time I won the photo class of the Overlord Dinner activity ~ most of the clothes in the audience can choose a piece to shoot.
In the end, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother after 95, it feels a little bit green, I hope that in the customer shooting action guidance can give more advice ah ~ very talkative, the shooting process is more pleasant.

On the home page, let's take a look at Queenie
To the store first fill in the name and telephone and then choose the costume, wedding dress can be selected, changed three or four sets of clothing is also quite patient, after the selection of makeup for a long time, the service attitude is good, the back shooting will teach you how to pose, is the feeling of the face is so big, the refinement said it is half a month, three or four days to send, it feels as if there is no difference with the original film
【Environment】Overall fine.
Plenty of optional clothes.
There are about three makeup positions, and inside is the studio.
【Service】Very welcoming and attentive.
The stylist was very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make up for it.
【Experience】Maybe the shape is a bit too much, the original double eyelids were pasted with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrow has also been shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for the daily non-thrush.
The photo was given for ten days, but the P-map effect is not very satisfactory, and it feels like the double eyelid stickers are still obvious.
Because I don't know what style to want, I tried two sets of them, and I chose a black dress, and my sister said that this set was more Hepburn retro style
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up and hair The hair stylist and the makeup artist sister were super patient in helping me get the result very satisfactory
After getting my makeup and hair done, I started taking pictures The photographer instructed me to pose the whole time, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious
After filming, I carefully selected four favorite photos when the refinement little brother said that the film within 15 years was very satisfied with the ending
Haven't replied for 3 days... Since your system doesn't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can I waive it until you have investigated and then charge my monthly fee?
Is it reliable to buy insurance with a small umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan to be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very harsh, summed up is to have strength, to be approved by the national authority department of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervision of insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders must have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured does not have to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies of star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest list of Hetai Super Mary No. 5 serious illness insurance, claims and underwriters are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: The products of the Internet platform, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: This is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this piece, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, feel that they are healthy or compliant, so it is easy to have a lot of hidden claims, there may be the risk of being denied.
I myself have done insurance telemarketing at "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Xiao Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true and reliable, unreliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are also a lot of misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the heavy light, will not tell the insured, the first month 1 yuan, the next month is needed to be charged according to normal, dozens to 200 range, many customers deduct a year or two to buy what is not clear.
Thinking that you can spend 1 yuan, the insurance company pays 6 million (the world drops the pie).
Free mobile phone delivery, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 this special policy number section is sent, and if the winning SMS is sent, they do not redeem, no one reminds.
(For the insured, it is another pit) free 60,000 serious illness insurance, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of real serious illness, 60,000 can not solve the problem, the future life began to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, the platform is no problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and the cost performance of some products is better than that of Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, and saving 2,000-3,000 yuan per person in premiums per year.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
Me: Minya insurance broker, has 3 years of business management training experience, served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying, I will start from customer needs, tailor-made insurance products for customers, insurance, for customers to shop around, try their best to fight for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy collation, policy custody, so that customers rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
Hope my answer is helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not too "ritualistic", and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

No problem, remember no need to arrange resending, I have purchased another one and do not want to waste
Thank you for your help
From before to now, I have opposed any form of slander and insult, let alone accepted such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, then making ridiculous posts, to your attempts to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive approach.
After that, you intensified not only according to the frequency of six meals a day to continue to tag me, but also on Facebook with your so-called friends continue to brazenly discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, appearance, body, good health, and what kind of strawberries grow in bed, whether to insert or not to insert messages, I... That's it.
Later, I received a number of friends about your Facebook friend's account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent anymore.
After the news of my report to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, we need to be respected by both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this ridiculous, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can continue to say that you are just caring and caring about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your drawing or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there's a girl who would want someone to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said yes, and you won't believe it either.
I don't think there will be any girl who can say she's okay after being so bullied.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not have even basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut off some of the messages for everyone to comment
You should post yourself that no one can impersonate you
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization
Will smile
Vietnam People's Daily Network - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Ish attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, which focused on the two major themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 epidemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Muang Hung said that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the number and operating income of digital technology companies in Vietnam will maintain a growth momentum of nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam will be cultivated, focusing on solving the major problems facing Vietnam, many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Nguyen Muang Hung called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for the development of national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to undertake the national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared various breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling the resources of the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, work together to promote the country's digital transformation, and Zhu Hui's post-epidemic economic recovery.
In his speech at the forum, Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation is the only way for the world and an objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation serves everyone, so it needs to mobilize all people to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and enterprises.
Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, and it needs to be based on internal forces, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.

U.S. three aircraft carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-CHINA media Multidimensional report: The latest news from Sino-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; The US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is strategically located on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carriers that are now cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the CARL Vinson, are the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried for the first time the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, is also based on the USS Ronald Reagan in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdale".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) U.S. three aircraft carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam On January 17, 2022, the US carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15).
Analysis said this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China's Most Powerful Weapons Rare Visit to Guam In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture shows Fiery Cross Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, state of readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 Thunder Submarines in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles based on the U.S. mainland, as well as nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to a friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta, which wiped out $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that "facing unprecedented competition" for what reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the income mainly comes from advertising, today's money-making advertising companies, they have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional targeting, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising network", many apps are connected to Meta's ads, through Meta's advertising platform is to achieve monetization.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get the user's data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will be obvious whether users will allow the app to obtain their own information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from Companies that make sea businesses in China.
Meta has an office of about a few hundred people in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from Byte.
Various agents in China are helping Byte to go to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked into it lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of massive burning of money overseas by Chinese companies is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in revenue, but more importantly, how the future is expected.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story for the market, Zuckerberg told the "metacosm".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the metacosm has a relatively long realization cycle, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook is very beautiful now, there are 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars in revenue every year, in fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software are now relatively high in daily life, but also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and the subversion is also a blink of an eye.
And engaging in the meta-universe of this unattainable concept, in a short period of time there is no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a road of no return The above is some of my thoughts, for reference.
