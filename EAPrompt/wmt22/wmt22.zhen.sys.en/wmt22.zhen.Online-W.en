Students sing the lead role at ZJU's annual academic conference Research results make people's brains explode - Xinhua
Washing hands with air, taking a breath to determine disease, and searching precisely for the source of haze A series of brainy academic achievements were honored at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Annual Academic Conference last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life science, humanities and education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, and some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Family Medical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-end biosensor on site, half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to gently exhale, this set of instruments can be from the composition of your exhaled gas, the initial detection of physical health . "
Zhang Diming said that the set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions, generally detect the temperature, pulse and other physical parameters.
This set of biosensors uses a new material, graphene, whose target is chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optical Science and Engineering, opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases early detection and removal are not in place, related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room . "
Shen Junfei said, for example, when the early examination of cancer, if the doctor can not see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical light has four light discs, which enhance the degree of differentiation of different tissues under the light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadow-free rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and received better feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of National Challenge Cup.
Hand washing with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Just stand on the device's hand washing station, our weight will be able to compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air, at the faucet to form a fluid, and water combined together.
Thus, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as the ordinary hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, both to ensure the degree of washing, but also to save 90% of the water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention won the only gold medal among many of the world's top schools.

A certificate that I find very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills that I feel is important in addition to my driver's license!
To popularize: first aid measures are actually to do emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, i.e. resuscitation before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time during the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then we only have a window of four minutes to live, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone around us collapses, we can use our professional knowledge to resuscitate him, instead of standing there stupidly motionless and unable to do anything, this helpless feeling is too frightening.
"In China, we have official data of three million accidental deaths each year, the most dangerous called cardiac arrest.
In the United States nationwide is an average of 15 percent can be saved.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, seventy to eighty percent can be saved, and less than one percent in Shanghai and Beijing."
That's according to Lu Le, founder of First Response.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, breathing is gone, the heartbeat is gone, you pinch the person is of no use.
You have to do artificial respiration and chest compressions to save the person.
I found that few of us would have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens it's too late, so I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when faced with an emergency situation.
It may even save a life!
First aid certificate can be registered in your local Red Cross training center, I was registered in the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, students still have a discount it.
PS: The last picture is a record of what I want to accomplish by the age of 25, and it was only a few months ago that I added the first aid certificate to my list of goals, but I did accomplish it!
The next thing I want to do is to get other certificates, and I'm going to get a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Little Red Book, and I think I have to have a first aid certificate to get this certificate, so it's actually very useful!
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#
One of the $13 shrimp dumplings!
Never tried
How come #NAME# is not clear?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery, and this time there is only one shrimp dumpling for me!
Because I saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word.
But you have to say that the film is not a highlight, it is not at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, those that make you sleep soundly in the cinema, and those that make you feel angry after watching them.
Han Han is really gifted at insulting his audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from a gram-novel, unnamable, with as many holes as a trench coat on a pony.
Even after watching it you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director in it, but when you think about it carefully you find it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I'd like to briefly mention some of the plots that I have a hard time understanding.
The main character lives on an island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on him.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the plot is arranged in the neighborhood of a grandfather driving a minivan to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
A senior citizen riding in a van from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then this old man did not follow.
In the abandoned ship to open a hotel, the heroine his brother how to get a business license?
The island biker party punks why can easily do a section of the mountain road to close the road?
Then the middle of the road to send rebar trucks parked on the side of the road, surrounded by even truck drivers can not find.
This sense of prop is too obvious, right?
A credit can not and suspected of breaking the law of the punk flyers why will become an auxiliary police?
In the face of loan sharks why not call the police, the film police also specifically asked whether there is a difficult situation?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use the room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranged to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the room door to sleep overnight?
Such inexplicable plots abound throughout the film, and because they are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the main idea of the movie, or rather the movie has no main idea at all, it's just an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film you think he wants to make a comedy, after 20 minutes or so you guess it might be an inspirational film, halfway through you think it might be a drama that wants to reflect the difficulties of small town youth survival, after watching it you have no idea what you actually watched, followed by a deep suspicion of yourself, why do you want to go to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people are actually very familiar with all kinds of film formula, such as you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie step by step to success.
If you want to make a romance, then you can honestly talk about the feud between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not appear to be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng played the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and then can still sing), you can not go to open some even JFK looked at the brain hole can not be.
As for the female lead is obviously not retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5 year old, I really don't know if this is due to acting or the director's requirements.
There is one more thing I don't understand, Han Han as a race car driver why he is so keen to add crash scenarios in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to add to the audience's frustration?

South African doctors: Omicron spreads strongly but is mostly a mild disease
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the new coronavirus Omicron variant causes milder disease than the Delta variant, although the spread is faster.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 physicians in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the New Guinea patients they are currently treating are showing milder symptoms, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu, according to the Associated Press.
The group's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none have yet required hospitalization.
They are able to manage the disease at home, and most recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said. "
That includes older patients and those with health problems that would have been more susceptible to serious illness from coronavirus infection, he said.
By contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many had to be hospitalized within days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several more weeks to collect sufficient data, physicians' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases: only 30 % of newly crowned patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous outbreak; the average length of stay was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; and only 3 % of recent newly crowned patients died, compared with 20 % of deaths in earlier outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At this point, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease. "
He added: "It's still early days, and we need to get late data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we are only two weeks into this outbreak. "
In the meantime, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant new coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400 % increase in new cases identified in the first week of December, and tests show that the Omicron variant accounts for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save an abducted child?
If the famous public service announcement "No sale, no kill" is an analogy, then in a good environment without the need to "collect abduction", group prevention and anti-trafficking, so that the abduction is not profitable, risky and costly, this type of crime will not repeatedly occur. The actual fact is that the actual fact is that the particulars of the actuals are not the same as the actuals of the actuals.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Office of the fight against trafficking in children developed the emergency release platform for missing children information online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing child information and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that the app is called "Reunion", I felt a warm feeling.
The new technology means not only the name "literary", full of emotion, and the proper use of information technology, practical, effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
But before the case of trafficking is solved, the priority should be to focus on the personal safety of the victim.
The matter is divided into priorities, in the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be all death penalty" and other controversial topics, can be set aside, cautious discussion; but the rescue of abducted children can not wait.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to get away from the place of crime as soon as possible after getting their hands on them.
The search for the abduction operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one.
In this case, come up with such as "reunion" platform directly help to solve the case, to find the child effective way, is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the judicial protection, as well as the meticulous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the "protection of the young and the weak" care.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can do better.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting in a train station, the parents asleep, only to wake up to find the child missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as the parents of a young child, should have at least a fair sense of protection.
The two parents take turns to rest, or put the child under secure protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police fight against the crime of abduction, the party who buys the abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and sale starts at five years; in particularly serious cases, up to the death penalty, and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high, the maximum penalty is heavy, in the general trend of "lightening", the crime of child abduction and sale is obviously a heavier punishment of crime.
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking occurring every year.
This shows that some people are backward in the concept of raising children and have little legal awareness.
The legal education for this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely only on strict official law enforcement.
If the abduction "market" is widespread, the traffickers lust for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, the formation of "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the anti-trafficking action is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, to break the backward concept, the popularization of common sense laws, but also to help eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories and five grades: Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
Virgin Olive Oil or Natural Olive Oil is the oil obtained directly from the fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign substances.
It can be divided into three grades according to the acidity.
Extra Virgin: it is the highest grade, the highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
It has an excellent taste, a light and pleasant vegetal aroma and an acidity of not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, with a pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin: fair taste and flavor, with an acidity of not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with acidity over 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades.
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain percentage of virgin olive oil to harmonize the flavor and color, with an acidity of 1.5% or less and a transparent light golden color.
Refined Olive Impurity Oil or Olive-Pomace Oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): is the olive oil extracted from the pomace by the dissolution method and refined.
If you have read the classification of grades, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes for wine making, olives from different production areas and different varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best places to grow olive oil.
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions in terms of temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olive oil.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown sporadically in the suitable areas.
Main producing areas of origin (Mediterranean).
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. Similar climates are found in Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. in the southern latitudes.
Months of harvesting olive.
From March to June, the oil olive trees flower and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, transitioning from green to red, purple and finally black.
From November to February is the harvesting season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional composition of olive oil.
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic and linolenic acids, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the fats found so far.
Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Flames of Freedom Never Go Out
The online "Summit for Democracy" ( Summit for Democracy), convened by President Joe Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, came to an end Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and can never be extinguished by authoritarian regimes.
He also said he plans to hold a second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan's government representative, Councillor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Kwun-chung, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I've said before, as this summit shows, democracy is everywhere in the world.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the concerted efforts of the entire community.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the parapets of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good . "
"The second day of the Democracy Summit was devoted to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
The day coincided with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially from emerging digital technologies.
It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires firmly condemning all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools offered by the technological revolution. "
In a pre-recorded video address to the summit, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun Chung reminded participants of the ongoing concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and for China's ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the Chinese Communist threat.
Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [the CCP] poses to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we're failing.
And that's why we have to change . "
In a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Councilor Tang Feng issued a national statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy in Taiwan is still in its infancy, we have always been at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we don't have to seal off the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take it off the shelves to defeat disinformation. "
As the second day of the Democracy Summit got underway, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, found to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to facilitate human rights abuses.

I know.
But the restaurant kept delaying delivery for some reason
Turns out it's going to be #NUMBER
So anyway, I'm not going to order
No more food

You can't deliver, why didn't you tell me earlier?
I waited so long for you

Hello, the chicken that came from the restaurant was raw
I wanted to try the tennis but was afraid I wouldn't be able to hold out, so I wanted to find a similar price to practice first .
Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive ones will normally be friendlier than the cheap ones, these "starter rackets" are actually industrial junk.
They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the top of the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball can't be topped, and it is very difficult for the expert to manage.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, know that you can not learn, also know that you do not want to buy expensive, make a cheap to fool you, you play twice, will not play again, so this racket is cheap, you do not feel pain.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you progress, then come back to me to buy the expensive, I earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket also can not sell on the price, new racket 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, have a thousand dollars racket enjoyment does not smell?
Quite friendly to newcomers, but once you get past the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not get past the novice stage.
Orders have been delayed several times delivery time
Can you help follow up on it please?
postponed
Thank you.
Does that mean I already have a credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I need to ignore the original order?
Hi, I ordered food from this restaurant and it came with a lot of missing food and the chicken was raw.
#PRS_ORG# I was told to pick it up for no reason, please cancel!
I placed the order for delivery, there is no such thing as pick up

What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can get awards?
Some time ago there was an article "Look! Project managers can impact the gold medal Olympic project" article is very hot, which mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be the first, no one can match: moving bricks, travel, stay up late is the daily life of project managers, fire fighting, pot, apologize is not in the conversation.
A seemingly joking and flirtatious article, but also speaks to the daily hardships of project managers, behind the representative of the current project management work is not able to.
The people engaged in project management work, but also gradually choose through some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma in the work.
From the rising number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) enrollment every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.

In the past 10 years, the number of PMP® holders has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the old "experience" to do things, and the rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we have to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, the PMP exam can guarantee the project management work unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP / IPMP and other related courses, you can systematically master the ten areas of project management and the five process groups and other related knowledge points, but the real project management work is still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, the work can not be landed, project estimates are not accurate, poor control degree sensitivity, the project is delayed again and again; members of the division of labor is not clear, the team of "old grease "Don't know how to cope with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ......
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtianhua Xia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key talents in R&D and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles, comes with the online course of "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp .

Jetson advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival reached a record high of 1.77 trillion yuan in national online payment transactions compared to previous years.
On the one hand, people sighed at the increasingly strong national consumption power, and on the other hand, they had to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on the society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double 12", Gitzo Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Gitzo") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blindly consume and over-consume.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, China's residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but reflect greater variability in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and need to further improve their basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Youth Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the younger generation shows an overall trend of rational consumption, although it is very different from the label of "excessive spending", some young people do have excessive consumption, follow the trend of consumption behavior, and therefore This has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and has even led to an increase in social problems, so financial companies should be brave enough to assume social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Gitzo has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - GCC tackles common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on the country in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in both countries.
The Gulf Arab states are resolving their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long link between the two countries will facilitate travel and integrate supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have denounced as failing to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a longtime "competitor" and see its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia entered into direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
It is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures that will allow its member states to cooperate fully to face common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

No. The new mountain supercar exhaust sound maximum!
This time our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement of the Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million RM, a year of road tax RM more than ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
That forget I do not know, the data said 0-100km / h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably is the small myvi to 30km / h when people to 100km / h, well.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly illustrates the Lamborghini style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, just Google it yourself, I have organized some Google may not give the explanation!
Too much attention, go where everyone is looking, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
1km fuel cost in RM1 or so (owners do not care)
The posture of getting on and off the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because it will not be able to climb out of the cabin and then stuck half)
The sound of the engine is so loud that you will be deaf when you get off. (But still very cool)
The car is too big, parked in a normal parking space will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked to the next car when opening the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor speaks for himself, has nothing to do with the owner, ha ha)
Do not misunderstand, this video of the supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Want to shoot video for your car friends, welcome to contact us!
More car information you didn't know about at The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
A car accident involving millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that car enthusiasts know each other, Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercar, and Porsche 911 car price is also a million grade!

Look at the results, expensive for a reason!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit, refers to the development of a university in the process of long-term accumulation of a series of school philosophy and value pursuit, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, universities have taken on a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For our universities, which emerged in the autumn of the national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of "Mingde Jiji, Xiuqi Zhiping" and The spirit of the university is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, and advocates the values of "Ming De Ji Shi, Cultivating Qi, and Treating Ping" and the patriotism of "Xing Xue Guo Guo".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines", while demonstrating the confidence and determination of China to move from a large higher education country to a strong higher education country, has put forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to be among the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time and speed up the establishment of several world class universities and a number of world class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap to achieve "overtaking"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, universities should also give full play to three kinds of advantages: first, the advantage of latecomers, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated in 5,000 years and promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to coalesce The third is the institutional advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the system of the socialist country, strengthening the goal-driven, gathering consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing to its strengths.
The characteristics of the school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of characteristics: firstly, highlighting the characteristics of training innovative and entrepreneurial talents, constructing an integrated education environment with the integration of science and education, school and enterprise, and forming a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlighting the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary crossover, and actively cultivating crossover emerging disciplines and landmark crossover achievements Third, it highlights the characteristics of school system and social services, carries out deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerates the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University's industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with each other.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking the truth and innovation", the common values of "diligent learning, cultivating virtue, discernment and practicality" and the motto of "Accepting the rivers, enlightening the truth and virtue, opening up things before the people, and making our country a nation" together constitute the spirit of Zhejiang University. "Together, they constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the university to adhere to the correct direction of school running, accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual power, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching.
Among them, the "sea of rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and expresses the quality concept of learning from world-renowned universities; "Qizhen Houde " emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, the university should receive the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality; " open up the things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research, as well as the reform and development, and the reform of the old and the new. The spirit of patriotism and dedication is emphasized in "Make our country a better place", which means that the university should always share the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual philosophy and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of operation.
"The intelligent person hears in silence, and the wise person sees in the unformed " .
Chinese universities should further base on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, they should adhere to the humanistic care and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit can stir each other, thus providing inexhaustible power to achieve national prosperity and national revitalization and realize the common ideal of human beings.

As NFT is flaming out of the ring, a new concept has emerged from the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game with blockchain technology as the underlying layer, which brings together a variety of gameplay methods including NFT, and is currently the most traded NFT project, with over $3 billion as of now.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, which is directly comparable to "King's Quest".
On August 6 of this year, Axie Infinity officially said its daily users have exceeded 1 million.
With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player, but can participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise in the track, which means the choice of the underlying industry of investment, firstly, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best state of industry growth after the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics is to "do the things right", that is, to do things right.
And strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to implement, in most tactical thinking above, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve On top of improving campaign engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right campaign KPIs to achieve the right campaign goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and pulling in new customers accurately; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years in the making, Bitcoin is celebrating several milestone events in 2021.

Asian American group complains about discrimination in admissions at Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools - Xinhua
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against three Ivy League schools -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- for discriminating against Asian American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington, D.C., the same day.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to top U.S. schools has grown exponentially, but the percentage of Asians at the three top U.S. schools has remained at essentially the same level, said the group's president, Yuh-Kong Cho, at the conference.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "systematically discriminate against Asian applicants over time" in a so-called "holistic" admissions process.
A 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that the three colleges had the lowest acceptance rates for Asians among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants, according to Yuke Zhao.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and that Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicant students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting their complaints, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to stop these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the facts are determined.
They also hope that the colleges and universities under complaint can take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change their admissions policies for Asians.
The three colleges and universities that have been the subject of the complaint have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition, founded in 2015, had complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination at that time, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
This time, in addition to Chinese American groups involved in the complaint, it also includes Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American and Pakistani American education groups.

Linmou in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the payee signature, which contains, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit to the seller, such as the seller is not willing to sell this plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign the plant sale contract within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to form a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sales, payment methods, resulting in the delay in the signing of the contract for the sale of housing.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It is easy to look at the house, the deposit paid, the house is also ready, just "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, the seller is not sold, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
The court heard that the parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract, can not be attributed to the defendant alone, should be reasonably presumed to negotiate, so the case should not apply the deposit penalty, the defendant does not need to bear double the return of the deposit for breach of contract liability.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
Lawyer reminds】 In the transaction process to do the necessary prudent attention to the obligation.
When signing a contract, the buyer should exercise the necessary prudential care, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and to specify in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
（After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement on Saturday (Dec. 11) that the United States had organized the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, use democracy as a pretext to fight against democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' with disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for U.S. intervention in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and 111 leaders from around the world were invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia slammed the United States for its own faulty democracy, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit.
There was also skepticism internationally and within the United States, such as criticism that the invitees included leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and suspicion that the Biden administration's true intentions were not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing the summit.
German Chancellor Scholz, who just took office, also attended the video democracy summit
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sickly, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social cleavages, racial tensions, and the division between rich and poor becoming more and more acute" and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
President Joe Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good. "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted , " we must renew it in each generation, which, in my opinion, is the defining challenge of our time . "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuing and troubling challenges.
For its part, the U.S. pledged to follow up the Democracy Summit with a year-long initiative that includes $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States expects countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democracies before the physical Democracy Summit, scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said , " Let's all countries follow through on our commitments and report next year on the progress we've made " .

Education thinking: how to make the university exams " " " academic dregs " each in their place - Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university exams, and raising the difficulty of the exams, changing the type of exam questions, so that the exams really reflect the actual level of students' demands.
Indeed, university exams have long been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of study, their learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable that the assessment of such a diverse group of people will have different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will certainly cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the blitz before the exam, and if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the effect with half the effort.
In this way, there is a "dregs" usually do not put in can also pass, and even scored high; " school bully" usually never drop class, homework, notes are good, the test is not much higher than the "strange status quo " .
In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University do not reflect the problems in the university examinations for no reason, and I believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who have written letters to express their views.
In fact, people who have been to university are well aware of the phenomenon of surprise preparations, trying to find various ways to "get" exam questions from teachers, to get the scope of the examination, to get "key tutoring" before the examination is not uncommon, and even in the examination with a cheat sheet, after the examination to beg the teacher to lift the hand The situation is not uncommon.
In the author's opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guide, the measure of a university examination is more on the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific questions based on this.
At the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether or not to fully master the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in university examinations.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the subject, in terms of knowledge, there is not much room for change, basically fixed.
As a teacher said , " 20 years ago to learn the basic knowledge of college mathematics, and now still learning, or focus . "
But just because the knowledge is basically the same, it doesn't mean that there is a single type of test question or a repetition of test questions.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of question groups, and then senior teachers in the subject coordinate the composition of the test paper, and the exam is also marked by all teachers who undertake the subject to participate, so that to a certain extent to overcome the repetition of test questions.
However, in order to develop a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions are normally distributed in terms of difficulty and ease according to the overall situation of students' learning.
The examination is the baton of university education. With the kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation program, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Regarding the students' suggestion letter, the university of Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a plan to rectify the situation in the whole university.
Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and self-examination against the end-of-course examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper propositions and review links, refine the grade evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of a single type of test questions, repetitive questions and other issues is the university examination needs to face the issue, of course, need to introduce the corresponding system, but the work is valuable in the daily, need teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also must eat through the student learning situation, both ends eat through, teaching and learning will be better docking, the formation of a positive interaction, the examination will be more in line with the actual, so that The "school bully" and "school dregs" each have their own place.

Testing.

In addition, the notice also proposes that cities with conditional ports of entry may study the setting of buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
National Health and Health Commission Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, the person in charge of the introduction, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, the two sides of the frequent exchanges of border people.

Oil tube video bottoming out the truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. military - Xinhua
(Video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the Oil Pipe platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the U.S. war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocents, committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
The U.S. military has used drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting humanity and setting up death squads.
In the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military has set up "black prisons" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
The crimes against humanity have stirred up more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the U.S.-style "war on terror" is "getting worse and worse.
Instead of bringing peace and democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, the war has brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of America's bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism" and the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and the preservation period of the perspective of why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help do canning, although canning belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and listened to are exactly the same, there is no difference between them.
Then people will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged milk powder one year, while the shelf life of the listened milk powder is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, from this point on many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but we think the expensive is good.
There are also consumers out of this mindset after eating the reaction also said listen to the taste or flavor is not the same!
Now I'll talk to you first about the reason for listening to the expensive, expensive where?
They are the same raw materials why the price difference is so big?
Because most of the manufacturers in the pricing time to consider if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that manufacturers generate very low profits, or no profit, then manufacturers rely on what to survive it?
So they have a large increase in the pricing of listening to the package to protect their profit margin.
So most manufacturers are mainly pushing the listened to, rather than bagged.
There are so many manufacturers you want to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, the cost of where?
We can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display costs, product giveaway costs, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So various manufacturers are also increasing the new products, and is listening to the suit, its price is also rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs out of the new products.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials to increase the cost of up to no more than 3, 4 yuan.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, by any means, linked with the hospital doctors, they assist in the promotion of the product, from a hear inside the profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And the relevant Chinese laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in cans at home on the premise that this will save money, while increasing the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no effect on small children.
Also, you should not think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of listening to the bag and the bag is the same after opening the bag, only that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, easy to moisture deterioration.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the fire of success books.
Today's success books, many of them promote the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do", and then tell you need to do things "What it is".
That is to say, it is the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it" that has been crossed at once.
Because of this, these books have a common feature - either you do the best you can, or simply do nothing; either is 100, or is 0; either you will climb the mountain, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle", let anyone look at it will admit that "the right incomparable", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "you have to make up your mind, do it again, a 180-degree transformation" path, which is precisely the Achilles heel of many people.
For people who are stuck in the old ways, who refuse to change, you have to shout "you have to change" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-defeating, playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "change" cowardly, stagnant, difficult to make up their mind; or with the impulse of the moment painful "change" of the determination, and bravely take the first step, but often is not long, do not last much longer to It is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic strip "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it is often beyond the limits of ordinary people's ability, so that the majority of people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way to let more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the bar" - it encourages a theory of "small wins make big wins". The theory that if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the sand dune in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold is significantly lowered, so there are more possibilities for ordinary people to do persistence, and everything as long as persistence, the probability of success will also increase.
Only follow the "second best principle" of the road to success, the journey is slightly longer.
In short, although the "best principle" on the surface of the banner to let everyone succeed, but it can ultimately motivate, in fact, a few; and the "second best principle" to effectively motivate more people, as many people as possible to benefit.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
The newest monitoring results show that the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Naked carp, commonly known as "Huanghuang fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to the massive human harvest and the degradation of the breeding waters.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has been closed to fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through artificial stocking, cleaning up the main rivers into the lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage".
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, a total of 180 million naked carp have been artificially released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
Qinghai's Three River Source area is an important ecological barrier and water-conserving area in China and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, Qinghai has released the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Qinghai Lake key waters ban notice, building a "river, a river and a lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

I just read an article about menstruation, it's too long.
For men who don't know about it.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13-15, and menopause around the age of 50.
After that, they will come more regularly once a month, provided they are healthy.
However, it is not so regular that it can be precisely predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, which requires advance preparation, and sometimes bad luck can roll over (suddenly several days early).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person, some people have three days, some a week; some have little flow, some have a big bloodbath; some have little reaction, some have pain until the ambulance transports them away. Menstrual pain changes over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt for the rest of your life.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding 24 hours a day for a few days from the beginning to the end. All you can do is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto your clothes and chair.
The main reason for menstrual cramps is the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the physiological period before the menstrual cramps start can effectively relieve the pain of the month.
It is easy to have diarrhea before the physiological period because of the congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins.
If it is about time for your cycle and you somehow get diarrhea, you will basically get your period within two days.
Tampons are best changed once every two or three hours, otherwise they tend to breed bacteria. The worst case scenario is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that's 42 pieces, and if you add the prepared copies in advance there may be 50 pieces, not one for each month.
(here to amend, tampons do not need to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once can, up to eight hours)
The menstrual period hormones may be more cranky, ovulation will also be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, is very unlucky, the body to their own trip.
But the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and will not take emotional problems to make excuses.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the uterine lining is the thinnest, after slowly thicken, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (lining thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day for several days a month, and abdominal pain and back pain, who wants it?
But a person can be born because his mother had menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come into the world, and everyone should be grateful that their mother had menstruation regularly and healthily.
A lot of things about women used to be suppressed, society brainwashed women that it was dirty and shameful, and people thought that's what it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the act of preparing the female body for the conception of life is disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking that way, men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this life and do not know much about it, do not be so ungrateful and do not know what is good for you, how can you face your own mother with this attitude and how can you want your own children?
Finally, the sisters try tampons, really good.
Today is the winter solstice holiday, send the wrong more disappointing
To order a separate meal for children to eat
I hope the store is busy to check the production
The footbath soaking feet numb is a leakage of electricity?
Choose the right footbath can play a good role in foot health care, today the Gomez editor will answer this question, I hope it will help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health care awareness, footbaths are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from more than a hundred to thousands of dollars of footbaths in a wide range, giving consumers a lot of space to choose.
In the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, footbaths and other health care appliances sales boom, but footbaths are not specifically industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
"In the electrically charged water soaking feet, it is too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a footbath to his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numb feet when soaking.
Mr. Li at first thought that the footbath vibration function caused, did not expect to turn off the vibration function, the father still felt the soles of his feet tingling.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, the electric pen actually lit up, Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was actually charged.
Later he contacted the merchant, the merchant's attitude is not bad, despite the return of the footbath, Mr. Li still feel unhappy.
Because he found that the footbath has been popular for a long time now in the highest temperature setting, for what kind of people, what materials to ensure harmless and other aspects are not a clear and detailed industry regulations.
But in general the footbath is not charged with the problem, but does not exclude a few products in the factory without strict control.
Therefore, in the purchase of the choice of split footbath.
Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time you can just take the electric pen test.

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian aid you have given to our loved ones during the more than 30 years since they were killed, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has been uninterrupted so far.
Today, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become employed.
It is your kindness that has helped our bereaved families through the most difficult times.
Now that the New Guinea epidemic is raging around the world, most of our donors have reached retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop your humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers, our hard-luck family, as it is long past time to bring this humanitarian relief campaign to a perfect conclusion.
I will always remember your love and am convinced that your acts of kindness will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of IFCSS and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in engaging in humanitarian relief.
In their engagement in humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are two parallel organizations, with program implementers often crossing over.

Relief money often does not reach the June 4 victims smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, the Tiananmen Mothers set up a special group to coordinate and take care of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund. After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans had graduated from college, MCDF established the June Fourth Orphaned Elderly Special Needs Relief Fund, which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these programs, mainly from campus and community donations in the year of June 4, comes from generous donations from individuals and is supported by the Brotherhood University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
It was only last year, after 31 years, that the victims of June 4 finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong collected in the name of June 4 back then.
During this time, Human Rights in China was also independently implementing their humanitarian aid program.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop the June 4 donation was made for the sake of the donors, and that we are indeed all retired elderly people who do not have as much income as we did before we retired, so we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter "To Friends.
We will respect the decision of the families to discontinue this program within two years and resume it as soon as needed.
We would also like to express our gratitude and respect to those who have continued to give generously and risk their lives to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you for the rabbit review originally said that the rejection of the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style but I did not expect the finished product out simply too beautiful
Thank you for Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity to continue to move forward, we will continue to cheer!
This photography studio is really great Strongly recommend all partners to!
Whether from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post are impeccable.
Makeup artist is particularly delicate, according to your style with a makeup suitable for you, cosmetics are also used in a line of major brands.
Tian Liang teacher needless to say, photography that is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing good point studio need to line up six months in advance, colleagues have shot in Beijing, look at the finished film think just so so.
We purposely searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, think this is also the short version of most people, the photographer Liang will capture, record the natural wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post design, a fine team.
The finished film came out we as well as the people around us are full of praise.
I have already recommended my girlfriend to go over, and she has just seen the negatives and is also full of joy.
I hope such a studio is not buried, more people find ta, shoot out of their own style, not the same.

A programming whiz who wants to share his personal experience.
If it is intended to enter the industry is the choice to find a place to train, but if there is no idea in this regard, it is best to learn on their own good, after all, training to spend a lot of money, and also with 6 months of time to learn.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, then training is really a very good choice, especially those who have weak self-control and training is a very good choice.
If your own self-control is stronger, you can also choose to learn on your own, but will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
The first thing to look at this institution's faculty, if the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution is not very meaningful, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students who came out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution will know how this institution in the end, explain the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, you ask this question I do not know how to answer, because for your own situation did not do a certain introduction, and learning this thing and the individual's own situation has a lot to do with.
For example, your major, your age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional has graduated, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-learning, this is the least efficient and costly, now a lot of offline training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, the second investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months.
But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-study is very convenient, and now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b site also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the profile, get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some more classic books can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but also able to pay a certain amount of money and time cost of learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also people dedicated to answering questions, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion quota, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the back of the job search interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above is my opinion, because I do not understand your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can always contact me for communication.
I said 1 o'clock before arriving, I saw in the App
What do you mean?
I have not finished, what are you doing?
I, undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-hung water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, hoods, installation of lamps, wipe glass, professional seam, housekeeping services

Life will not disappoint every person who works hard, like to follow me, thanks to those who silently give me praise
Life is like this, others only look at the results, their own sole support process, the face of life, we are strong, in addition to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back ......

When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and I was happy when I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and I was happy when I achieved it; when I matured, I found that happiness was a state of mind, and I was happy when I understood it.
Do the most real and kindest self, according to the heart, no regrets in this life; life a road, go your own way; life two treasures: good health, good mood, beautiful live to old age!
At each stage of life, you will encounter different problems.
Many times, what binds you is not the ability, but the courage to actively face.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it openly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by the difficulties; if you face the difficulties, the problems will be solved eventually.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to hold the first Saudi Biennial of Contemporary Art - Xinhua
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on Dec. 11 at the JAX Art District in Diriyah, northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, director of UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the Biennale is "Crossing the River by Touching the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transition, and reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, and is presented in six sections: "Crossing the River by Touching the Stone," "Heritage as Experiment," "Thinking on the Edge," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation and performance art. In "Behind the Story Series: Endless Streams and Mountains" (2014), Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting from waste.
Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hoped the Biennale would create an international dialogue and give a global audience the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative community and to strengthen interaction.
The goal of the Biennale is twofold: to engage Saudi contemporary art in a global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art," said Tian Feiyu. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, in which artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: coordinate and standardize the management of rural public service positions - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Dec. 12 (Xinhua Lin Bifeng) in order to continue to do a good job to help the population out of poverty employment, consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced to promote rural revitalization of rural public welfare positions management-related policies to help promote the overall revitalization of rural areas.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare jobs for the placement of rural difficult groups such as laborers out of poverty, which play an important role in helping people out of poverty to realize employment and increase income, consolidate the results of poverty eradication and effectively enhance the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new rules are jointly issued by seven departments of Yunnan Human Resources, Rural Revitalization and Finance, mainly for the recruitment of grass-roots rural public service positions in the scope of the object, fund management, job development, job management and other aspects of unified norms.
In terms of job development and setting, the new rules clearly state that in accordance with the principle of "setting posts according to needs, determining people with posts, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person one post, voluntary and open, unified management " principle of setting.
Recruitment procedures must be in accordance with the announcement, declaration, review, public announcement, employment, pre-service training and arrangements for induction and other steps.
In addition, the new rules also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public service positions, rural public service positions subsidy standards and subsidies, stipulate that the development departments of rural public service positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public service positions placed staff; require the relevant departments to regularly monitor the issuance of rural public service positions subsidies.

Second, although the right wing in the history of the era of ambition, but not long, so short because a little sunshine will shine, drink some boiling water will sweat; a little ambition will be to get the long view, by the blow will be the hair will be attached.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social problems.
However, I am against his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups and mud, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, change or improve China should have patience and responsible attitude for the country and the people, political speculation in an attempt to take the chestnuts in the fire, that is not the right, is the bastard.
Talk about the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning to society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left does not have this creation, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently saw some friends dislike the anti-traitor while refuting the left epilepsy, but also quite dynamic, I think it is not necessary.
The traitor and the left epileptic do not try to reason, are a tendency, no reason to speak.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not try to make the traitor and the left epileptic admit, why bother?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you fifty cents, when the left epileptic calls you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are teenagers, but when they are old, they forget them, or pursue them, but they are reduced to paranoia.
And the ideal drifted away, and even dragon slaying teenagers eventually become the evil dragon.
Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China from the history and culture of the innate genes leading to China as a whole should be left.
The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens regulation and focuses more on fairness as well as security.
Now society in general wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are fighting each other, the left is certain, it is estimated to continue for many years.
Although you can't understand it, click on it and you're done!
I don't want to say anything else, flowers are so righteous
In the past two years, the U.S. Empire's blockade and siege of Huawei chip, not only let Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also let the "U.S. system" enterprises suffered huge losses.
The U.S. empire suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, a direct consequence is that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits have been affected, resulting in lower investment in research and development and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global shortage of disruptions in the chip supply chain.
Now the "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies to stop production, cell phone prices, almost all the industries that use chips are deeply affected by it.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries of the technology giants began to move towards the "de-glorification" of the road.
In order to firmly control the global control of semiconductors, to control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old U.S. has been moving a lot recently, and is hosting the "chip summit"; and is inviting 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance, and pulling money to support the U.S. domestic technology giants, for example, the old U.S. empire technology giant Intel in order to recapture the dominant position in the chip field For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business to the public.
When most people thought that Intel's move will have some impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why so sure, because Intel as the United States empire old technology giant, in the field of semiconductor deep decades, has a large number of talent team and technology reserves, will be able to quickly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was not impressed.
In the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, for Intel to spend money to build fabs this move, Zhang Zhongmou no scruples to say: Intel build chip foundry, quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still harbors a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had been the pearl of the U.S. empire's manufacturing industry, majestically occupying the top position in the world, and was the world's hegemon in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been in the hands of a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only be deterred by the huge construction costs of production lines.
Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to see a division of labor and cooperation after entering the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were those specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Chang's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC aimed its main business at "wafer processing" as a single segment, not designing but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC was a small minion in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, once Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing part of the chip industry, it was obvious that it had some high regard for itself and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on the wafer fabrication services at that time.
I didn't expect that the giant, who looked down on wafer manufacturing services, would now start doing foundry work.
So, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it's ironic that Intel entered foundry.
Now TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in the 14nm 7 years ago.
Want to catch up in fact is not an easy task.
Do not wait
By 19:06 it's 2 hours to place an order 😅
Today to see some [strange hot search].
What's a normal opinion?
Randomly pick three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Holliday's price hike, and Cargo Lala incident, the public opinion spreads to form a wave, then [the index drops] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, and a small hump will appear again if secondary public opinion is generated.
They look similar to the [evolution model of online public opinion] once shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is an unusual public opinion?
Six randomly selected hot searches in the same event show [solitary peak-like], [sawtooth-like], and [cliff-like].
The [lonely peak] is artificially heated, which quickly rushes to the top of the hot search list and attracts public attention; the [jagged tooth] is periodically heated, ensuring that the topic is coiled in the hot search list; the [cliff] is collectively withdrawn, and the hot search has finished its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.

The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for science, which lead to war to create momentum, which divert attention, which influence perception, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which hostage decision, black production accounts in batches, sub-nodes of refined combat, taking into account almost all elements of the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, putting aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from objective data, black PR will have nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks by will leave traces, such traces, let's dig out together.

Mauritius and other countries found the first case of infection with Omicron strain - Xinhua
BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of cases of infection with the new crown variant virus Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health Kailash Jagutpal, an infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; another infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After being treated in hospital isolation, both infected persons tested negative for nucleic acid and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron strain infection have been confirmed for the first time in the country.
These three people are students, who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month, and were not hospitalized because they were all mildly ill.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Serbian government has been increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over 12 years old who arrive by air are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer New Crown vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbitzer Chibunda said on 9, the country's first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain.
The country's health department sequenced the genome of 12 positive New Crown samples collected from Nov. 9 to Dec. 2 and found the three cases of infection.

Dami 360 integrated home furnishing
Address: 12/F, Happy Home, 156 South Huancheng Road
At first, I was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the beginning of my budget is 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
When I came to the store, I started a series of deception.
I was the first time to the store just to show them my floor plan, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they can actually give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably showed me their materials and do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second scam is that you will be dragged to pay the deposit as soon as you arrive at the store (and once the money is paid you can never get it back, unless you have enough experience to fight a theoretical battle with them).
I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you, you just pay the deposit today we can give you how much discount.
This is a big hole, I am a living example of being cheated, in the impulse of the mind, paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
He gave me a quote with a lot of questions 70,000 does not include plumbing and electrical remodeling, does not include any doors and cabinets bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the base installation.
In addition to these their service point fees were higher than other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and was told to sign the contract without any clarification at the beginning.
When I went to them for a refund they acted like they were very experienced and had a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
In any case, they will bite the bullet that it is the customer's problem and they are not responsible.
A variety of shirking responsibility, there are many details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friend to find them to renovate the house is also bad quality, later to give you a variety of costs.
The daddy, they are the original fraudulent leading decoration, now changed to the great beauty, seems to have collapsed and changed to other.
So we do not choose such a dumb decoration company.
In the future, when you choose more Baidu look at these check these consultations because the renovation is not a small amount of money.

The starry sky has an appointment丨The Geminid meteor shower will be extremely large on the 14th - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Xinhua Zhou Runjian) astronomical science experts, as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the Geminid meteor shower will be extremely large on December 14, like the meteor shower friends can be observed in the second half of the day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on Dec. 13, 2018.
The parent object of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Fahrenheit, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "birthed" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director, astronomical science expert Xiu Lipeng said, like the New Year's blockbuster, Geminid meteor shower generally appear at the end of the year, "the release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high and steady flow, and is known as one of the top three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A distinctive feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of meteoroids, rich colors and many fire meteors, which are suitable for both visual and beginner astrophotographers to shoot.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jingjing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on Dec. 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will be extremely large at around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors per hour that can be seen when the radiation point is located directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
The Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by the moonlight, and the excitement will be a little less.
The 14th is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon phase is full convex moon, bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but the moon will set in the second half of the night, when the Geminid meteor shower's radiation point will also rise higher.
If you like meteor showers, you can observe them in the second half of the night after the moon, but be careful to keep warm. "
How can I observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside, choose a place with a high altitude, little light damage, and an open view facing northeast, then patiently wait until the moon sets and observe visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you do not need to keep staring at the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
For those who like photography, it is best to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting to produce a gorgeous 'meteor shower.
A tripod, spare batteries and shutter cables are also essential for stability and continuity. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
To my understanding, the traditional TV the subject refers to should refer to the LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning differences, there are two main points.
First, the laser TV more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the LCD TV full-scale market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size more in 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest more than 100 inches, fully meet the user demand for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the laser TV in the global shipments and sales accounted for an increasing proportion of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above accounted for more than 60%.
According to the forecast of CEC, in 2020, laser TV market sales growth will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high growth.
The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted from the laser light source is not directly into the eye, compared to the backlight luminescence of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute Sai Xi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch the laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, resulting in 144 sets of test data.
The data confirmed: laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye-care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, the laser TV more focused on high-end market.
In contrast to LCD TV prices continue to dip, the current price of commercially available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, with the size and light source upgrades, the price gradually climbing.
What makes laser TV sell so expensive?
There must be a reason.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV projection distance is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, to achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the space required is not large, and the host is small, taking up very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Plus the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has its pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment can be, afraid to listen to one side of the story.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle near focus projector - laser TV, in order to close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflector, which does not meet the optical best design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel curtains is costly, and the price of 80" can basically replace a 65" LCD.
One more thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point, come on, the eyes can see the light on the curtain for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be serious LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", turn on the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
And, the projection curtain if not diffuse reflection, simply can not become like.
Just ignored the high gain curtain hot spot (light spot) effect, a certain angle a lot of light reflected to the eyes, that is really uncomfortable.
The aesthetics of the photo studio preferred quality store of the WenPhotography vision temporarily no branch
WeChat reservation date, the lady will send me the optional schedule, the response information is more timely ~
Before going to see the store's shooting works, more outdoor wedding, shooting beautiful, involving a lot of shooting styles.
After arriving that day and the lady briefly exchanged their ideas, very patiently helped me try two sets of my tangled style clothes, and finally finalized the start of makeup styling ~ the photographer will set up some props before shooting, will guide the action, the details of each is also more excellence.
But probably because I did not communicate with the specific shooting ideas, so the shot is not the style I want, but should be good 🙊 🙊 🙊
The photographer will help select the photos after the shoot and communicate the post-production style, feeling quite attentive bah.
The repaired film will take about half a month, waiting for the effect ~
The second time I won the photo class bully event ~ most of the clothes in the room can choose a shot.
Finally, I chose a black sarong to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is a 95-year-old brother, feel slightly still a bit green, hope that in the customer shooting action guidance can give more advice later ah ~ quite chatty, the shooting process is more pleasant.
The Wen regency visual aesthetic photography gallery preferred quality store Reply
On the front page, also come to see Queenie ~
To the store first fill out the name phone and then choose clothing, wedding dresses can choose, change the three or four sets of clothing is quite patient, choose a good makeup for a long time, service attitude or, behind the shooting will teach you how to pose, is to shoot out the feeling of face is so big, finishing said to half a month, three or four days to send, feel as if there is no difference with the original film
The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who are not able to get a lot of money.
The actual fact is that you can choose a lot of clothes.
The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who are not able to get a good deal on a lot of things.
The actual service is very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also be very serious to teach you action.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to make up the shot.
The actual experience is probably a bit too much, the original double eyelids were pasted out of the third eyelid.
The end of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for the daily non-drawn eyebrows.
The photos were given in ten days, but the P-graph effect was not very satisfactory, and I felt that the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to try two sets of results to pick and choose or choose a black dress sister said this set is more Hepburn retro style
After choosing the clothes and start to get the makeup hair hairdresser and makeup artist are super patient in helping me to get the effect is very satisfied
After finishing the makeup and hair began to take pictures of the photographer throughout the command of my pose process is very easy and harmonious
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorites as finishing touches, and my brother said that the film would be ready within 15 days.
It's been 3 days since I replied to ...... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan because your system doesn't recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I pay with the same credit card every time!
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Is it okay to waive it and charge my monthly fee after your investigation?
Is it reliable to buy insurance with Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the set-up conditions: according to the "Insurance Brokerage Institutions Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)" tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, promoters in the last three years without major illegal records, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC.
These three is actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the CBIRC (regulation of insurance companies, banks within the country) of the state authority, shareholders should have good style, as an insurance brokerage company of the small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can reach.
At this point, it's not bad and it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelves of Hetai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, claims and underwriters are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because less business network operating costs, and the cost of salesmen's wages, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and flexible payment methods, support for monthly payments, to reduce the pressure of the policyholder's payments, while you can maximize the leveraging of insurance.
This is still a very good point.
You can consider.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professionalism requirements of the industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this piece, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when taking out insurance, think they are healthy or in line, so there are easy to have a lot of claims hidden danger, there may be The risk of being denied compensation.
I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The Internet insurance is real and reliable, but what is not reliable is the people, the Internet channel does not have professional practitioners, and there are many misleading sales.
For example: 1 yuan insurance to protect 6 million, buy insurance to send cell phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important, will not tell the insured, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal charges, ranging from a few dozen to 200, many customers deducted a year or two of their own buy a what is not clear.
Think you can spend 1 dollar, the insurance company to pay 6 million (the world fell pie).
Free cell phones, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such special policy number to send, and if the winning SMS issued, they do not exchange, and no one reminded.
(This is another pit for the insured) free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, is a short-term, if only rely on this, no other commercial insurance, in case of a real serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future of life began to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So a comprehensive view, the platform is no problem, the product is also no problem, there is a problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject consider carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than the Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, premium savings of $2000-3000/year each.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Ming Ya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in corporate management training, served nearly 1,000 corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from the customer's needs, customized insurance products for customers, in the insurance, for customers to compare three, try to get the best underwriting results for customers, after the insurance, for customers to do policy organization, policy trusteeship, so that customers can rest assured worry-free.
We will grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be of help to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all the steps can be done by the policyholder independently.
Although the Internet insurance is not too "ritualistic", and may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract in any way.
This model, which is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", can also be a fatal problem in buying insurance, and that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, so when we buy insurance, shouldn't we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and will provide services to us even after many years? Is it an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and provide us with services for many years?

Thank you for your help
From before to now, I am against any form of slander and abuse, not to mention the unacceptability of such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but it is this kind of villainy that must be eliminated.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to your flirtatious posts, to your attempts to post my alleged home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive stance.
You have since intensified your efforts not only to keep tagging me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some subtle, humiliating comments about me, my looks, my body, my fertility, and what to grow strawberries on the bed, and whether or not to penetrate, I... I didn't mind.
But then I received several messages from my friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and sexual harassment comments.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not stop at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political affiliation is, or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect for both genders.
Yes, you can continue the flirtatious, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments, you can continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to argue that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot and do not have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge me for my looks or my body.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me how I was doing.
You wouldn't believe me if I said yes.
I don't think there is any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic moral character would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the eye of the beholder.
I've cut off some of the messages for you to comment on
You should have no one to impersonate you in your own posting
All I can say is that you are a public enemy of civilization

The U.S. three aircraft carriers are assembling around China, and the most powerful weapons are making a rare visit to Guam.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait on Jan. 9.
The Strait of Barabac, which connects the South China Sea to the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vinson will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the carrier USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Fish Hawk carrier aircraft.
The U.S. carriers now cruising in the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, are the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on Jan. 3.
"The USS Abraham Lincoln also carried for the first time a squadron of F-35Cs, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stockdal.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam On Jan. 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China.
(Weibo @SouthSeaStrategicSituationalAwareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers are massing around China, and the most powerful weapons are making a rare visit to Guam.
(Weibo @SouthSeaStrategic Situational Awareness) Another CNN report reported on Jan. 17 that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China in a rare visit to Guam, the most powerful weapon, a signal to allies and foes in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region, according to analysis.
It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to the island since the 1980s.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China's Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
Pictured here is China's Yongxia Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness and ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines.
The whereabouts of the 14 Boomer submarines in the U.S. Navy's fleet are generally kept strictly secret.
The secrecy surrounding the ballistic missile submarines makes the Boomer submarine "the most important survivor weapon of the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I was talking to a friend about Meta's recent 26% plunge and $251 billion market cap evaporation, and Zuckerberg's response that it is "facing unprecedented competition".
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's ads, and they can realize cash through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the data information of users, which affects the efficiency of ad placement.
Apple's privacy policy is very user-friendly now, and will obviously prompt users whether to allow the App to get their own information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow.
The next stab from Google will have an even greater impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the China factor, which used to be part of Meta's revenue growth, has been weakened (not sure how much, but it's there).
We all know that Meta has no business in China, but that's not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from companies that do business there.
Meta has an office in Hong Kong with about a few hundred people, and several major agents in China.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is the advertising channel they can't get around, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, TT of Byte is one of the main competitors of Meta now, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the first two years.
All the domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money in overseas is over.
Third, new traffic channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline of revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at the revenue, but also at the future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about the "meta-universe".
Meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of Meta-universe is rather long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now is very beautiful, also has 100 billion to 200 billion dollars of revenue every year, in fact Facebook now is very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although his several social software is now a relatively high daily activity, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but the face of tiktok's rapid development, Facebook also has little confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye.
And engage in the meta-universe this unattainable concept, a short period of time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg and change the name of the company, and constantly looking for a new track of the fundamental reason, but I think his track selection is wrong, is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
