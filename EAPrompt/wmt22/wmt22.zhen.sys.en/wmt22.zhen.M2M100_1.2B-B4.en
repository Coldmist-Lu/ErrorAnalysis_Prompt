Zhejiang University art annual student singing protagonist research results open the mind - new Chinese network
Wash hands with air, judge diseases, accurately search for the source of fog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, research covering environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and other major fields, students from a curious idea to create many high-end inventions with applied value, some of which have been awarded internationally.
Biosensors: Your Home Medical Examiner
Dr. Zhang Diong, a PhD student at the College of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smartphone side, only half the size of a smartphone.
“You just have to breathe a light breath, and this set of instruments will be able to preliminarily detect your health from the composition of the gas you breathe.”
Zhang said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will appear on the phone.
The smart bracelet that can detect health conditions on the market, generally detects physical parameters such as temperature, pulse.
The biosensor uses a new type of graphene material, its target material is chemical elements, and its sharp "smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Lights: The Doctor’s High Energy Eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart lights are also used in the surgery room.
The invention won the Silver Prize at the 44th Geneva International Invention Show this year.
Zhou Lin Yuan, a master's student at the Faculty of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, and the team of Shenzhen Fei opened a new way of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented the intelligent LED surgical light.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's surgery room."
Shen Fei said that, for example, when examining cancer early, if doctors can not see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four discs that enhance the difference between different organizations under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness depending on the needs of the surgery and personal habits at any time.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated children's hospital and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the National Challenge Cup first prize.
Washing Hands With Air: Water Saving and Cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, scratch a little soap, press a little hand wash, and Li Khalifa and other students invented a set of "air hand washing devices".
As long as we stand on the toilet of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a light bulb.
The compressed air forms a fluid in the head of the drone and joins with water.
So we can wash our hands!”
Experiments with color reactions and bacterial residues show that the effect of hand washing with this method is the same as with ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, both to ensure the level of cleaning, but can save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second major global challenge summit, the invention stood out among many of the world’s top universities and won the only gold prize.
Please repair it as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel your order and refund your money, don’t score, and no longer use #PRS_ORG#!
Cucumbers and peanuts are not suitable for children.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not for now, thank you.
He called me to tell you where he was #PRS_ORG#
I can't wait and cancel the order.
I bought #PRS_ORG# but I wrote the wrong address
Can I change?
Or cancel an order.
Okay, it is trouble.
A meaningful certificate – emergency certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I found important in addition to a driving license!
Public: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue when an emergency occurs, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still a period of time in the process of ambulances after the accident, and this is the most crucial time.
This is the time when urgent assistance is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and a breathing stop, then the window of our lives was only four minutes, gold four minutes!
So people around you know how important emergency care is!
When someone falls around us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly and not doing anything, this feeling of helplessness is too frightening.
“In China, our official data shows that three million people die accidentally every year, the most dangerous of which is heart failure.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78 percent can save, and in Shanghai, Beijing, less than 1 percent.
This was the first reaction of the founder, Lu Lu Lu.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, breathing is no longer, heartbeat is no longer, you sting in the person has no effect.
It is necessary to do artificial breathing and pressure outside of the chest to be able to rescue the person.
I found that few of us now have this awareness to learn emergency aid, but it is not too late when things happen, so we call on everyone to learn this skill and let us react in time in the face of emergencies.
It can save a person’s life!
The emergency certificate can be enrolled at your local Red Cross Training Center, I am enrolled at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhejiang, and there are offers for students.
PS: The last chart is recording the goals you want to accomplish before the age of 25, adding emergency certificates to the list of goals was also a few months ago, but it is indeed done!
Then go to examine the other certificate that you want to examine, intend to examine a diving certificate, before seeing a diving emergency certificate in the Red Book, this certificate seems to have an emergency emergency certificate to be examined, so the emergency emergency certificate is still useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of the $13 crumbs?
have not tried.
Why is #NAME# not written?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# Leaked meals, this time for a strawberries to eat me?!
Because I found the code to be effective.
To conclude, I personally think the Four Seas is a full-length shit, in all respects.
But if you say that this film is not a highlight, it is not at least a good choice.
A lot of kinds of shit, you can fall asleep in the movie theater is one, you can see the aftermath of anger is also one, the Four Seas for the audience is like a monkey on the ears, it can in countless ways to light up your anger.
In this point of insulting the audience, Korean is truly talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature in the novel, difficult to name, and there are many flaws like the shirt on the body of the little Mago.
Even after viewing it, you’ll doubt if there’s a metaphor of the director’s implication, but when you think about it carefully, you find it’s actually shit.
First, let me explain a few things that I find difficult to understand.
The man's home should be on a small island in the south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then the story arranged a gentleman in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old man sitting in the car from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very reassured.
The old man is not below.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned boat, how did the owner get a business license?
Why can the island's flying car party small mess easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck that sent the steel pipe in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, not even the truck driver could be found.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why would a small blunder car party suspected of violating the law become an auxiliary policeman?
In the face of Goliath loan, why not call the police, the police in the movie also asked specifically whether there were difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door in a hotel with a room card, then forcefully arrange not to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the room door to sleep?
This bizarre plot is filled with the whole film, and it’s so unspectical that it hurts me when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main purpose of the film, or that the film has no subject at all, is a look disgusting seamless.
At the beginning of the film you will think he wants to shoot a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an incentive film, half of the time you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the survival of small town youth, after watching you do not know exactly what you watched, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why over the years to run to the cinema to admire sputum.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with all kinds of movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then encourage + comedy and tell the audience how a talented cookbird is step by step towards success.
If you want to make a love film, then you can honestly talk about the conflict between the youth of a small town who loves motorcycling and the maid of the waiter.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your plot can’t show up something contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle Yin was just burned, and then can still sing the role), you can't go open some brains that even Kennedy could not endure.
As for whether the actress is obviously not a weak mind that can act in some ways like a five-year-old child, I really don’t know whether this is the reason for acting or the director’s requirement.
Another thing I also really wonder why Korean as a racing driver is so keen to add a crash story in his own movie?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival archives to get the audience stuck?

South African doctors: Omicorn transmission is strong but more slight
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus Omicorn variation is milder than the delta variation, although it spreads faster.
With the spread of the Omick variation in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa’s Houden province that patients who are currently treated with the new coronavirus have had milder symptoms, such as physical pain and coughing.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he looks at dozens of patients every day, but that no one needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: “They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation.”
This, he said, includes elderly patients and those with health problems who would have been more prone to fall into severe conditions due to coronavirus infections.
He said in comparison to the previous wave of the delta epidemic, he treated new crown patients with "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
Many will be hospitalized within a few days.”
Within two weeks of the first report in South Africa of the Omick variation strain, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take weeks to gather enough data, medical observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of new coronavirus patients hospitalized in recent weeks were serious, half the severity rate of the previous wave; the average hospital stay time was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent new coronavirus patients died, and 20% of early outbreaks in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as saying: “At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a more mild disease.”
He added: “It’s still too early and we need back-to-back data.
Typically, hospitalization and death occur late, and we only have two weeks to get into this wave of epidemics.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the world’s leading strain of the new coronavirus, Omick virus cases are emerging in dozens of countries, South Africa being the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases discovered in Houden province increased by 400 percent in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Thanks to the support of today, 80 boxes have all been sent out!

Education Time Review: What to Save Kidnapped Children?
If compared with the famous public welfare advertising phrase "without buying and selling, there is no killing", then in a good environment without the need for "collapse", group control and people's counter-collapse, so that the smuggling is unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the criminal investigation Bureau of the Ministry of public security kidnapped the disappearance of children's information emergency release platform.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the disclosure of information about missing children and the timely retrieval of abducted children.
The app is called “United” and is very warm.
The new technological means are not only called "literature" and filled with emotions, but also informational use is proper, practical and effective.
The primary objective of the law enforcement is to recover the kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
However, priority should be given to the victim’s personal safety before the case is resolved.
The matter is very urgent, and under the urgent purpose of "searching for rescue", such as "should child trafficking be punished with the death penalty" such as widespread and controversial topics, can be postponed and cautiously discussed; but the rescue of kidnapped children is not allowed.
According to the detective experience of such cases, traffickers tend to move away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible.
If the operation is delayed by one minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of investigating the case will increase by one point.
In this case, to come up with effective methods such as a "unification" platform that directly helps in the detection of cases and the retrieval of children is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, “robbery” is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice, and the tightness of law enforcement, there is no need to implement the care of "care for the weak."
In addition, prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can be done better.
For example, a common case, a family of three rested at the train station, parents slept, awakened only to find the child is missing.
You can’t expect a two-year-old to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
The alternate rest of both parents, or the placement of the child under proper protection, is the least measure to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police’s fight against the crime of smuggling, a party buying kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual misconduct is often only part of a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of China, the statutory sentence for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; in especially serious circumstances, it can be sentenced to death and confiscate property.
High punishment, the highest punishment, under the trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is clearly a heavier crime.
There are still many smuggling cases every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in the concept of raising children and lack of legal awareness.
Legal education for this part of the people should be followed in parallel.
To effectively control the crime of smuggling, it is not possible to rely solely on official strict law enforcement.
If the "market" of the bribery is widespread, the bribery of the dealer will constantly innovate the means of the bribery, form the "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the bribery will inevitably fall into the mud of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking backward ideas, popularizing legal common sense, also helps to eradicate child trafficking and buying off crime.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil.
First-pressed olive oil, or known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits after taking mechanical cold pressing, filtering and other processes to remove foreign objects.
Depending on the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin olive oil: is the highest level, the highest quality olive oil, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant plant smell, acidity not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly higher in acidity, but not more than 2%, taste pure, fragrance.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil): The taste and taste are still strong, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining the primary crushed olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming a "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of raw olive oil to reconcile the taste and color, its acidity is less than 1.5% and has a transparent golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil that is extracted from the oil and refined by dissolution.
After looking at the classification you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Olives are like grapes that brew wine, and olives from different regions, different varieties of olives, will produce different standards of olive oil.
Best cultivation of olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions needed for oil olive growing, such as sunlight, air humidity and precipitation.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be grown in the habitat zone.
Primary region of origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on, with its climate similar also in the far southern latitude of Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on.
Month of olive oil harvest:
Every year from 3 to June, it is the time when the olive tree blossoms, and from 7 to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, with the fruit transitioning from green to red, purple, and eventually black.
November to February is the season of harvesting fruit (the freshness of olive oil is important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oleic acid and sub-oleic acid, manganese acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition found to date.
Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom never goes out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries, civil society and private sector leaders, opened on Friday (10 December).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global “Democracy Summit” next year.
Taiwan government representative, political affairs commissioner Tang Feng, and Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights activist, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: “We know how difficult the work is ahead of us.
But we also know that we can face the challenge because, as I said before, as this summit showed, democracy is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime will never quench the micro-fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: “As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen our democracy, to push for reform, to transparent accountability and governance, to be more resistant to the forces of autocratic buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.”
The theme of the next day of the “Democracy Summit” will be defending human rights, consolidating democracy and opposing authoritarianism, as well as counteracting digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that democracy faces challenges globally, especially the challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.
“It is time to reaffirm our shared values and positions and our democratic resilience.”
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including the exploitation of all the tools offered by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong’s Democratic Human Rights activist, Ron Yong, spoke at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees of continued attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, including Hong Kong and Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: “For a long time, the world has accepted China’s rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold accountable.
That’s why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our priority.”
Rouhani also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party.
“Maybe some of you are afraid to irritate General Secretary Xi, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don’t recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that is the reason we failed.
This is also why we need to change.”
During the round table of discussions on “Fighting Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values”, Taiwan’s executive committee’s Governing Affairs Commissioner, Tang Feng, released the “National Statement” via video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shares his experience with how to combat the new coronavirus through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: “At a time when Taiwan’s democracy is growing, we are always firmly at the forefront of global confrontation with authoritarianism, and we play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retreat.
In Taiwan, however, we don’t have to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don’t have to shut down it to defeat fake news.”
Simultaneously with the next day of the “Democracy Summit”, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to be seriously violating human rights, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to use surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

The chicken from the restaurant is live.
Want to try tennis, but also afraid of not being able to persist, so want to find an approximate price practitioner.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendship, if it is not possible to distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap shot, such a "introduction shot" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the kick, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not stand, and the best man is difficult to control.
The logic and subtitle of their existence is - - tennis is so difficult, knowing that you will not learn, and also knowing that you will not be afraid to buy expensive, get a cheap stuff to mess with you, you will play twice, you will not play again, so this kick is cheap, you will not be hurt.
As soon as you can really distinguish between good and bad, showing that you have progressed, at the time to come back to me here to buy expensive, I earn twice the money.
Proposal to spend the same price, buy a second hand better shot, choose Prince, or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good shot can not sell the price, new shot 500, 600 is good, second hand 200, have a thousand dollar shot enjoyment is not?
It is very friendly to newcomers, but after the newcomer phase is over, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newcomer phase.
Orders have been delayed several times.
Can you please help me follow?

In fact, there are a lot of questions about the combination of clothes for thin girls.
Fat girls wear dresses can not be too short or too long, the length is almost the same as the knee, just can cover the thick legs.
The dress is too short to show fat on the legs.
Too long can make you feel thin and fat.
If you wear the three sections separated from the upper and lower, it appears that you are naturally increased, that is, the upper body, the dress and the long socks are in different colors, and it looks like it will produce a feeling of length.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for small fat girls (this point is deeply experienced by the author), deep colors are also a good way to mask your fat body, and the noble and elegant black short dress is also the first choice for small fat girls.
Wearing dark colored clothes, especially black shorts, will make you feel a little thin.
If your legs are fat, do not wear your socks and shoes too attentively.
The more popular the better, the color should not be too bright.
So that people don’t feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For small and thin girls, it is necessary to talk about the tricks of dressing.
Fat girls should not wear tight short dresses, in addition to the shirt not too short or attached to the dress, will look very uncomfortable, if the leg is thick, to wear black long socks or grid socks (the kind of fine grid), choose textually soft printed horny dress, combined with a curly shirt, can be very good to cover up the fat girl's deficiency.
Of course, thin girls also wear short dresses.
Fat girl wearing a short dress, should choose a shirt consistent with the color of the shirt, this will make your fat body has an increase in height effect.
The short dress with high heels shoes can make your legs look longer, this is the most IN matching of the summer!
If you are overweight, but the legs are very thin MM, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can cover up your big stomach, but also show your advantages.
The short dress will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, the shirt to choose some tightness, the formation of a level feeling will be more thin.
Simple single-white T-shirt combined with a short dress, fat MM can also try.
Small fat girls are also able to wear fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing well, thin girls will also be the focus of attention.
After there are changes in dressing, there is also more exercise in life, and fight to get rid of the label of small fat girls a day earlier.

Girl targeted for sister to raise donations: "It's better to think it's an ironic injury" - Xinhua Network
A girl in Hangzhou Wooling Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl gonna be a'shoot target' for sister funding" exploded the circle of friends.
Photographs show that a girl in Hangzhou Wooling Square stood in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a man, and the wooden board was written "human-meat target, ten yuan one arrow", indicating that passers can use archery to shoot after payment.
The move has sparked interest among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's downtown branch confirmed to the New York Times reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an excessive move for her sister to raise donations, but this behavior is not worthy of encouragement, after warning, the girl had left the local station yesterday.
Girl Street "Arrow Target" fundraising is warned
In the photo, a long-haired girl in the form of a "one" stands in front of a large wooden board, the black ink on the board with the word "human meat target, ten dollars a arrow", she wrote on the other wooden board in front of her bank account and WeChat, payment treasury account, etc.
The picture appeared on the Internet and caused controversy.
Some netizens believe that this move is "the begging act of the bowling eye", and many netizens have expressed sympathy for it.
"We found the situation when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and the crowd was not much around."
In an interview with local media, the civilian police at the center near the scene said that there were two girls, all about 20 years old, dressed beautifully and youthfully.
Among them, the "human target" girl has been crying, asking people to play this game; another girl on the sidelines helped to drink, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia, now urgently need surgery, please help.
“We contacted the local police in Guangzhou to learn that the girl was raising a donation for her sister’s leukaemia treatment.”
Last night, the head of publicity of the downtown branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the New York Times reporter that the girl was named Jigari and raised a donation for her sister Jigari.
But because the treatment still takes more than 300,000 dollars, it was not possible to think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as the target, one responsible for hitting the hand, but did not participate in it, and during the whole process no one was found to shoot the arrows, only someone looked around and took photos sent on the microblog.
After the police identified by the security department, the archery used does not fall within the scope of control.
The head said, "I do not advocate the adoption of this type of bowling fundraising."
After the warning, she left the office.

What’s the biggest fire in 2021?
The Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only the Olympics can win the prize?
The previous period of time there was an article "Have a look! project manager can hit gold medal Olympic project" article is very fiery, in which the project managers in many projects, absolutely can be a horse in advance, no one can match: moving bricks, traveling, staying overnight is the project manager's daily, fire rescue, bacon, apology is not in the words.
A seemingly joking article, but also outlines the daily bitterness of project managers, behind which is the lack of attention to the current project management work.
And people engaged in project management work, also gradually choose to get rid of the difficulty in the work through some actions.
From the year-on-year rise in PMP (International Accredited Project Management Professional Qualification) enrollment, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the national cumulative PMP® application number was 600,000, the PMP® certification number was approximately 420,000, and the effective holding number was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® holding total.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificates has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply taking pictures of past "old experiences", and the rapidly changing working environment let us know one to learn, stand on the shoulders of science giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP ensure that project management works smoothly?
Many project management beginners say that by studying related courses such as PMP / IPMP, you can systematically master the top ten areas of project management and five major process groups, but when you really do project management work, it is still a fog.
Many project managers often feedback on the following questions: project management awareness is not in place, simply relying on personal experience, empty project management theory, not knowing how to practice; lack of system of project management process system support, work cannot land, project forecast is not permitted, the control sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed and delayed; members' division of work is not clear, the "old oil line" in the team does not know how to respond to cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R & D management in the field of more than ten loads, has helped numerous excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other key research and development talents, and obtained the honorary title of "Chinese enterprises R & D and management talents training demonstration base" and other "R&D project manager special training camp" online course.
This is an online method of fragmented learning, combining practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D-based enterprises, to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path of project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to facilitate the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operating results to the enterprise.
Speaking without blame, you can first see how other participants evaluate this course: this course is not only made by a team of experts (Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and many well-known companies' real business scenarios, to give an in-depth and professional interpretation of the course content.
It will also provide scientific practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students convert the content they learn to specific work after class.

On the eve of the "Twelve Twelve" to advocate rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observatory Network - professional financial and economic news site
This year, the amount of national network payment business transactions reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
A variety of full red packages, catching the eye of live broadcasts once again to benefit consumers, this consumption boom on the one hand makes people feel sorry that the national consumption power is growing strong, on the other hand, we must also calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the "double twelve", JSC Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "JSC") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the vast number of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excess consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Finance Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, up from 2.04 in 2019 compared with 2018.
Overall, China's residents perform better at the level of financial consumption, but in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, there is also a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, "old and little" will still be the focus of continued attention to financial education; Nielsen's "China youth debt report" and the "China youth consumption report 2019-2020" released by Central Bank of Finance showed that the younger generation has a huge consumer potential, credit consumption became an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, almost half of the people have no debt accumulation, and even if the younger generation as a whole shows rational consumption trends, although the "excessive volatility" label on the outside world is very different, but some young people do have excessive consumption, follow-up consumption behavior, and therefore generate excessive financial pressure and debt risk,
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JSC has been committed to helping people to build their own happy lives with high-quality and attentive services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of regulators to raise the consumption consciousness of consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, JSC has continuously targeted young groups, including university students, to carry out comprehensive and diverse financial knowledge dissemination activities, and through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practices competitions and other forms of subversion, to rationally guide the consumer needs of young groups, help them to establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and help them to accumulate wealth.
At the time of the arrival of the twelve, JSC reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and the correct money view, resist blind consumption and excess consumption, and avoid the mistake of consumer borrowing, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan in advance, measure and pay back on time.
If delayed, the delayed record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on future economic life such as buying a car, buying a home.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, JSC will as always, with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and continuously updated iterative financial products, bring consumers more suitable for demand and diversified services, continuously help the public to improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption, moderate borrowing, and become a lifelong reliable consumer financial partner.

Vietnamese People's Press Network - The Gulf Cooperation Committee Resolves Common Challenges
Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first time that Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt broke diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a full embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the Sea Society and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Committee in January 2021 when the Gulf nations signed an agreement on “solidarity and stability” between the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are appointing new ambassadors in Qatar through the two countries, leading efforts to restore ties with Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries have resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar as a result of demands that countries must unite for their interests and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi prince’s visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer channel will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with companies of the two countries signing 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran and world powers negotiating a nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to save Iran — a deal the Gulf Arabs have condemned for being unable to solve Iran's missile issue.
The Gulf nations have seen Iran as a long-standing “competitor” and viewed Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf nations believe that it is a flaw not to address the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia held direct talks with Iran.
The aim is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slowed the country’s economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The upcoming summit will be the first summit of the association countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Committee to re-evaluate diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unification of the Gulf and to propose measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Okay well
It is said that the new mountains are the most exhausted!
This car that our team brought for everyone is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini’s flagship supercar, Murcielago’s alternate model – Aventador LP700-4!
The price of almost two million marks, a year of road tax marks tens of thousands, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horses, how fast can you imagine?
The data says that 0-100km / h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, probably the myvi of the small group is only 30km / h when people reach 100km / h, well.
The low body of the car, the upscale cutting doors, the huge outlet around the car and the glass-shaped 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car does not need to say too much, Google itself is enough, the short article has some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
Too much attention, everywhere everyone is looking, very unselfish!
1km oil costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Exercise the posture of getting out of the car, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will not get out of the cab and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud and you will be deaf when you get off the car.
The car body is too large, it will be narrow in the ordinary parking space, and I am afraid to be knocked by the next door when the car opens!
A bit of loneliness, because there is no opponent on the road (the small talk itself, has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don’t get mistaken, this video isn’t for sale!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your love car, welcome to contact us!
More information you didn’t know about the car, at The Car Guide / People’s Car Journal
A car accident worth millions.
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are confident that all car friends know that the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also a million!
Before that, overseas crashed millions of sports cars 911 in just a few minutes, and tens of millions surpassed Chiron!
Look at the result, it is expensive!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the frequency - China Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school ideas and values pursued by a university that have been formed in the long-term process of development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the university spirit has been crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first university in the modern sense of the world, the university has taken on the unique mission of different from other social organizations, for our university, rising in the autumn of the national crisis, its spirit is more deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the value concept of "Mindzhi, consolidate and consolidate" and the patriotism of the "expanding power".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, the global competition in education, science and technology and talent competition is constantly increasing, and higher education as an important "supply side", its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan to promote world-class universities and first-class disciplines, while demonstrating the confidence and determination of our country to move from higher education powers to higher education powers, has also put forward higher and renewed requirements for university development.
How to work to rank among the world's most popular in a relatively short time, and speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, to the "curve overcar"?
In addition to firmly establishing the goal of self-confidence, the path of self-confidence, the ability of self-confidence, the university should also give full play to three advantages: one is to develop advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents overseas, learn to draw from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to a significant increase in academic level and quality of school; the second is the cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom of the Chinese civilization in the five thousand years of accumulation, promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shape brands, improve the image; the third is the system advantages, play the system superiority of the socialist country, strengthen the goal drive, gather consensus, optimize the allocation of resources, to accelerate
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university on one side, and at the same time, each school must showcase its individuality and characteristics.
School characteristics must have Chinese characteristics in common, but also reflect their respective unique objectives, school tradition and resources.
As for Zhejiang University, we emphasize the three characteristics of the school: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent training, build the integrated foster environment of science and education, the integration of university and university enterprises, and form the entire chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the second is to highlight the characteristics of the cross-disciplinary meeting, promote the optimization of the disciplinary system, create a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate the emerging cross-disciplinary and iconic cross-disciplinary achievements; the third is to highlight the school system and social services characteristics, carry out deep international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Pan Zhejiang university research and cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the schooling of "Innovation is the pursuit of innovation", the common values of "study, practice, understanding and practice" and the "Hina River, Hina Truth, Fatherland, Tree and Country" together constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of school, constantly accumulate cultural heights and consolidate spiritual forces, rich in content and far-reaching meaning.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the "heavenly talent for me" mindset, and acts as the high-quality philosophy of attracting the world's famous schools to educate; "Isaiah's Truthfulness" emphasizes the spirit of truth and goodness, refers to the university in the pursuit of truth at the same time, and accepts the hardships of German art and personality; "Isaiah's people" refers to the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, but also acts as reform and development, revolution and innovation; "Tree my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, and speaks of the university should always share honour
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit is where the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
“The wise hears in silence, and the wise sees in the unseen.”
Chinese universities should further build on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the current position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanitarian care and freedom of independence, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation intertwined, thereby providing an inexhaustible momentum for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

As the NFT burst out, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic starting to earn a stable income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-making game that brings together a variety of games, including NFT, and is currently the highest-trading NFT project, with more than $3 billion to date.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million per day, reaching King's Glory.
On August 6, Axie Infinity announced that it has more than 1 million live users.
The fire of Axie Infinity brings a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of the industry targeted for investment, first to choose a large industry, at least 100 billion in the market size; second, to choose a good industry for future growth, consider the industry growth to reach the best state in the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rough refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Go for the right course!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is “do the things right”, that is, do the things right.
The strategy is “do the right thing”, that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land, and above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about the continuous deepening of the current field or horizontal field extension (strategic thinking); for example, on how to improve the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on how to improve the participation of activities (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to the right activity goals, such as enhancing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, accurate pulling; on the increase of DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin has encountered several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small country of Central America, El Salvador, established Bitcoin as the legal currency, which is the first time Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch a Bitcoin ETF and be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, once again expanding the cryptocurrency investment space.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

American-American groups complain of Yale and other 3 frequently-Jitsu famous school enrollment discrimination - Xinhua Network
More than 130 Asian groups in the U.S. filed a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on 23 May to protest that three famous universities — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College — discriminated against Asian applicants during their enrollment.
The Asian Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group’s chairman, Zhao宇空, said at the conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria for U.S. top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian students in these three U.S. top schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have “long-term continuity and systematically discriminated against Asian applicants” in the so-called “comprehensive consideration” of the enrollment process.
Zhao宇空 said that a 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed that in these three colleges, the relative number of applicants, the Asian admission rate is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that of all U.S. universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented ethnic quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao宇空 told Xinhua news agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after filing a complaint and take measures to prevent the universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their enrollment.
They also expect the universities that have been complained to actively address this issue and change the admissions policy for Asian people.
Three universities have not yet responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015 when it complained of Harvard admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups also participated in the complaint.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned from the home intermediary of a factory located in Zhejiang Yue Yao Tong Township, and after several visits to the house, Mr. Liu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu consulted with the family of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the factory, and made a deposit of 200,000 yuan on the same day through a bank transfer.
Lin Mou signed on the factory purchase and sale settlement bill as the recipient, which states, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit is to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell this factory, the settlement will be returned to the seller twice, the two sides agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week."
However, afterwards, the two sides failed to form a consensus on the main contract terms, such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, which resulted in the late conclusion of the house purchase contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu.
It was not easy to see the house, the settlement was made, the house money was also ready, and the contract was signed "by the door and by the foot", but the seller did not sell it, which left Mr. Land helpless and angry.
For this purpose, Mr. Liu will prosecute Lin Mou to the Yuan City People's Court.
After the trial, the court concluded that the two sides ultimately failed to conclude a formal contract and could not be blamed only on the defendant, should be reasonably presumed that the consultation failed, so the case should not apply the penalty, the defendant does not have to bear the liability for the default of the double refund of the deposit.
After the judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second-instance courtined the original judgment.
The lawyer reminds us that the necessary caution must be taken during the transaction process.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer shall fulfill the obligation of due diligence, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and to specify in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to avoid the simultaneous performance of disputes between the two parties.
After the "democracy summit" on Friday, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said on Saturday (11 December) that the United States hosted the "leadership of the people's leaders summit", is "to ideological lines, to democratic tools, weapons, counter-democracy in the name of the false democracy, incite separation confrontation, and transfer domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on the people, promoting 'democratic transformation', abusing unilateral sanctions, and curating 'colour revolution', with catastrophic consequences."
‘Democracy’ has long been the ‘weapon of mass destruction’ for U.S. interference in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
During the two-day video conference, leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the emergence of American own democracy, saying the United States was unqualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning both internationally and in the United States, such as criticism of the invited attendance of some authoritarian leaders such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who suspect the real intention of the Biden administration was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Prime Minister Scholz also attended a video democracy summit.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "Today's American-style democracy disease is evident, money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social splitting, racial contradictions, poverty and wealth segregation and other issues are growing, and America's democracy is based on capital-based "rich game".
In his speech, President Biden said, “As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen our democracy, to drive reform, to transparent accountable governance, to be more resilient to the powers of autocratic buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest.”
He emphasized that democracy is not a matter of course, "we must constantly renew it in every generation, which, in my opinion, is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "are faced with ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign following the Democratic Summit, including a $4.244 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The U.S. hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the planned Real Democracy Summit in late 2022.
Biden said, “Let all countries carry out our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year.”
I am afraid he sent the wrong address.

Educational Thinking: How to Make University Exams “Scientist” “Scientist” Everything – China Network
3 students of Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school's leaders, reflecting the confusion about the university exam, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the exam type, so that the exam truly reflects the student's actual level of appeal.
Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a “hot topic”.
At the university campus, students come from five lakes across the sea, the level of competence is different, plus the degree of study is different, and the study situation is very different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings for groups with such multiple characteristics to be evaluated.
Of course, if the test topic type is single, the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not use the talent, may concentrate on the strike before the exam, if you think about other methods, it is possible to half the effect.
As a result, there is a "study junk" that is not used in the usual time can also be overrated, and even get a high score; "study hegemony" is never out of class, tasks, notes look good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
Thus, it appears that the students in Lanzhou reflect the problems in the university exams are not in vain, and believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou.
In this sense, I would like to congratulate the three students who wrote the letter straight.
In fact, people who have gone to the university are clear that the strike preparation for the exam, thinking of various ways from the teacher to "pick up" the examination issue, to struggle for the scope of the exam, to obtain "key counselling" before the exam is not a rare phenomenon, even in the exam with a copy, after the exam asking the teacher to raise a high hand is not a surprise.
In the opinion of the author, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, to measure the qualification of a university exam or not, is more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposal on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage of the university, the professional begins to segment, and many specialized courses are dominated by the basics.
Without a doubt, whether to comprehensively master the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university exam to be examined.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and from the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, but is basically fixed.
As some teachers say, “20 years ago, the basics of university mathematics were taught, and now they are still being taught, or focused.”
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not mean that the exam is single and the test is repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a task group, and then the senior teachers of the discipline will integrate the examination paper, and the examination paper will also be participated by all the teachers in the discipline, so that you can overcome the repetition of the test topic to a certain extent.
But to formulate a set of trial subjects that meet the practical teaching and learning, the subjects according to the student's overall learning situation, difficulty in presenting the normal distribution, also need to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the exam proposal is difficult, the subject type has a dynamic grasp, can both highlight the basic knowledge examination, but can also take into account the ability examination, at the same time for the subject type to innovate design.
The examination is the command bar of university education, and what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparatory examination program, which will affect the performance of university education.
For the student's recommendation letter, the Lanzhou University College attaches great importance, and the reform program has been deployed throughout the school.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to conduct study and course-end examination and self-examination, formulate examination proposals and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination proposals and audit links, refine the evaluation of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of courses and teaching aspects.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of the single type of test topic, the repeat of the topic, etc. are the topics that the university examination needs to face, of course, the corresponding system needs to be introduced, but the skills are expensive in the daily life, teachers need to comprehensively master the teaching situation, not only to grasp the teaching content, but also to grasp the student's learning situation, both will be better matched, teaching and learning will form a good interaction, the examination will also be more in line with the reality, so that the "learning master" and "learning junk" get their place.
If I can't change the location of my shop, can I change it?

When choosing a photo, because in the internet saw a lot of cases, not willing to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photo, really, not a little did not mean that we added a photo, 24 in the direct package, not one added (he heard that I almost time to take a wedding dressing cousin, more than seven thousand packages and more than ten thousand photos, at the time I was amazed, and I was also afraid that I would choose too much)
Today the photo was fixed, Lan Lan sent me, I saw two of them felt not very good, and they immediately helped me repair.

3,200 newborns without newspaper paper
The National Register of Saudi Arabia said that due to the use of special anti-counterfeit paper storage light, it was not possible to issue newspapers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and so far has accumulated 3,200 people affected.
However, the director of the agency, Kyle Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for newspapers, the information has been recorded in the system and will be replenished when the counterfeit paper is delivered next week.
At a news conference, he explained about a 10-month report on the issue of the printing of newspaper papers in Shaba.
He said the issue had arisen two months ago, and that Sarajevo was facing the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing specialized anti-false paper were affected by the epidemic, which caused delays in shipment to our country.”
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in the Saba newspaper paper is different from other regions, and therefore it is not possible to borrow stock from other states.
Kerou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has been shipped to Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month, and subsequently delivered to the printing company on 8th for partial printing work.
"The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Saba immediately for the final stage of printing, an estimated two more working days (20 December) can be delivered to the applicant's hands."
“We will notify applicants to go to branches around the world to receive newspapers.”
He added that Saudi Arabia has issued a total of 24,801 newspapers so far this year.
Wait from 7 a.m. to now.
Is it soon?
I mean food.
I’m back at #PRS_ORG.
Thank you, the restaurant is ready.

48-hour nuclear acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The Joint Defense Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a request to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control.
The Joint Defense Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of new coronavirus epidemics in port cities, requiring people who have recently left the port city (except for those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a 48-hour nuclear acid detection negative certificate, and to carry out at least one nuclear acid testing after arrival of personnel from the border port city.
According to the notice, the timeframe for the above requirements is from the date of determination of the port city scope and announcement by the municipalities of each province to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggests that conditioned port cities can study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffering zones within the jurisdiction.
For some port cities, cross-border trade is the local major economic pillar, and frequent exchanges between border citizens between the two sides.
The implementation of the differentiation management policy, from one prevention and outflow defense line to two lines of defense, is expected to the threshold of advance, compress the outflow risk of the epidemic, with the least social impact and the lowest social cost to the maximum outcome of the prevention and control of the epidemic.
Recently, there have been many domestic aggregate epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some local epidemic monitoring early warning is not timely, high-risk staff closure management is not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing flow in the form, cold chain items are not eradicated in place, centralized isolation site management is not standardized, epidemic emergency handling is not scientific accuracy.

The truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the U.S. military.
(Source of the video: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called The Killing Machine attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the U.S. launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", exporting American-style democracy through warfare, 20 years of poor soldiers worshiping, bloody sex, murdering innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drones to airstrike hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort humanity, and set up killing groups.
In the past 20 years, U.S. troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military has set up a “black jail” for torture and personal humiliation of the “suspects.”
A crime against humanity has sparked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terror” war is “against terror.”
The war did not bring peace and democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, it brought only a country full of acne and countless killings and destruction.
Let us uncover the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States under the name of “anti-terrorism” and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the point of view of the business and the period of storage, why this customer to the logistics company in the tax zone to help the container, although the container belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of the tax logistics company, here as follows this text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bag and the milk powder their raw materials are the same, there is no difference.
Then everyone will ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, and the shelf life of clothes is two years or more?
Why is the price difference between clothes and suitcases so high?
In fact, from this point, many consumers, or mom class think that because the raw materials are different so the quality will be a lot better.
In fact, just like raw materials, everyone thinks that what is expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating because of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of clothes is different!
Now let me tell you why it is expensive, where is it?
Why are the prices of the raw materials so different?
Because most manufacturers when pricing consider that if the price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, this means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a large increase in the price of clothing to secure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for listening clothes, not bags.
And you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of billions of dollars each year on advertising, what does this cost?
Everyone can think.
Then with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as the promotion staff of the shopping mall, the exhibition costs of the shopping mall, the gift costs of products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So the various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it is clothing, its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product that comes out with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials increase will not exceed three or four dollars.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by any means, linked to the hospital's doctors, by which they assist in the promotion of products, from the first listening to the profit of 30 to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact, this practice is damaging consumers.
It is recommended that you buy milk powder packed with bags in the container in the house, so that you can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no effect on young children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of the suitcase is longer than the bag, if the suitcase and the bag shelf life is the same after the packaging is opened, only to say that the bag is not easy to store after the packaging is opened, and is susceptible to deformation.
Delayed meals, the food is cold, cold after it is dry and hard, there is no way to eat.
The juice has also gone out.
Cancelled immediately, his #PRS_ORG# stuff supplied must be cold
I did not take it!
#NAME #Say you have no one to take it
We called past.
If you don’t pay back, I’ll call the police.
Several times using #PRS_ORG#, today was the worst experience
Absolutely unacceptable
Okay, I can
Remember the restaurant and the riders.
Avoid happening next time.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time was constantly delayed.
Not sure when to wait.
If the order is cancelled, you can get the money back.
How to pay for the rider?
More than an hour ago, a rider was confirmed.
No longer wanting to wait.
Do not scare people at the starting line.
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the fire of successful school books.
Today’s successful learning books, many of which are promoted as “best principles” — that is, first assume or imply that you can “do” and then tell you “what” you need to do.
It is equivalent to say that at once we have crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
That’s why all these books have one common feature—either do the best you can, or just do nothing; either 100 or 0; or you climb the mountain, or you just stay there.
This “best principle” is recognized by anyone, but 99% of people are scared before the starting line.
Because this theory is advocated as a path of "you have to be determined, re-be a person, to a 180-degree big change", and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For the person who keeps the rules, because of the old, refuses to change, you prefer to shout in his ear "you want to change", undoubtedly self-deceiving, to the bull piano.
The vast majority of people will be frightened in front of the two words "transformation", cluttered, difficult to resolve; or by momentary impulses hurt the determination of "transformation", and brave take the first step, but often the good prospect is not long, can not persist for a while to lose the line, difficult to see continuity.
The famous “From Tomorrow Starting” of Mr. Ma Smithi is the most divinely expressed classic of this “universal humanity.”
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limits of the ability of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people "look at the door".
Per, the “best second” principle is a way to get more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the “best second” principle lies in “lowering the threshold” — it encourages a “small win for big win” theory that if you don’t do 100 you can only do 1: because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you can’t climb the Thai mountain, you can only climb the small sand hill at your doorstep, because it’s always step faster than the original one.
Anyway, as long as you do something, you are always stronger than not.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to do insistence, and the chances of success will increase if everything is insisted.
Only following the success of the "best second" principle, the path is a little longer.
In summary, the “best principle” despite the appearance of the banner that makes everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire, in fact, a few; and the “best principle” can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many as possible.
Do I need to re-order now?

Qinghai Lake Nude Nuclear Resource Preserves Increase 0.71 Million Tons This Year
Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency
The common name of Qingdao Lake is "crabfish", a precious fish species that is unique to the Qingdao Lake, and has a significant role inining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qingdao Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as the increasing degradation of the environment in the waters of human killing and naked naked reproduction, the number of naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked naked nak
In 2004, the Chinese Red List of Species listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai province has implemented a ban on lake-fishing, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals to go to the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and lakes, and prohibiting the sale of nude fish and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial proliferation release and cleaning of Qinghai Lakes mainly into the lake river riverway, the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passageway" continued to increase protection efforts, and Qinghai Lake naked resource holdings increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy head of the agricultural and rural department of Qinghai Province, introduced that so far, Qinghai Lake Nude has cumulatively implemented artificial proliferation release of 1,8 million tails, and the contribution to the recovery of Qinghai Lake Nude Resources is more than 23%.
Qingdao is an important ecological barrier and water resource coverage area in China and even Asia, while Qingdao Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sichuan River and Qinghai Lake waters, protect the aquatic wildlife, and safeguard the biodiversity of the Qinghai Highlands, Qinghai Sea has since released a notice of prohibition on the capture of key waters in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive capture ban management system.

The restaurant only brought me a bag, to put in the bag, the weather was cold.
Do you want to ask, is the sale put in a bag?
I only saw a bag.
I wonder if I missed it or if someone took it, thank you.
It’s been an hour and I haven’t received it yet.
I just read an old article, too long.
Give an unknown man.
Most girls suddenly experience their first vacation one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and close their periods around the age of 50.
Then, under the condition of health, it will be more regularly once a month.
But it is not the rule to be able to accurately predict, approximately a week of public transportation, need to be prepared in advance, sometimes the bad luck will turn ( suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, the degree of pain varies from person to person, some people three days, some people a week; some people flow less, some people collapse; some people have no reaction, some people hurt to the ambulance to go, the pain with time will change, before no pain does not represent a lifetime no pain.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, starting within a few days until the end of 24 hours of bleeding, can only be done with a toilet towel or sanitary cotton pad to prevent the flow of blood to the chair.
Pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate adrenaline, the physiological period at the beginning has not yet reached the pain of the period, and it can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and after the start of the pain there is nothing to eat.
Pre-physiological period due to uterine blood filling and excessive release of prostate, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is likely to come to the cycle, the stomach will basically come in two days.
It is best to replace the towel for two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to reproduce bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace it 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if the pre-prepared portion can be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Change here, sanitary cotton sheets do not need to change often, about five or six hours can be changed once, for a maximum of eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more agitated, and the ovulation period will also be unstable because of the hormone changes in the body, which is very unfortunate, the body makes a trap for itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control emotions and do not use emotional issues to find excuses.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the falling endometrium.
The endometrium after the end of the menstrual period is the thinnest, then slowly thickened, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (endometrium thickened) ready to welcome guests, the guests did not come, all removed (menstrual discharge) the next month to build a new house, and began again.
Menstruation is very uncomfortable, decades in a row, a few days a month, 24 hours of bleeding, even belly pain, who would?
But a person can be born because his mother came through menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you to live in the house for 10 months when you first came to this world, everyone should thank their mother for the regular health of menstruation.
A lot of women's things were pressured before, society told women that brainwashing was dirty and shameful, everyone thought it was so, but the times changed.
If someone feels menstrual nausea, feels that the body of women for the preparation of the birth of life is nauseous, should not say it in the public, the girls stand up, don't think so, never experienced, this life will not experience, nor how to understand the men, don't so forgive the responsibility, no matter how, this attitude is how nice to face their mother, how good to want their own children?
Finally, sisters try the sanitary cotton, it really helps.
Today is winter solstice and it is more disappointing to make mistakes.
Ordering food for the kids.
Hopefully the store will check out the items.
Is the foot washing a leak of electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot care, and today's National American Review will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, foot baths are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, ranging from more than one hundred to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a great choice of space.
In the related data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, foot baths and other healthcare household appliances are sold, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
“Sweeping your feet in electric water is dangerous.”
Mr. Lee told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father's birthday gift, but when his father washed his feet, he felt the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath basin caused, did not think of shutting off the vibration function, the father still felt the foothills of the foot.
Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, and the pen was actually lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually powered.
Later he contacted the businessman, the businessman's attitude was good, and despite the withdrawal of the foot bath, Mr. Lee still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that this has been popular for a long time, there is no clear detailed industry regulation in the setting of the highest temperature, which population is suitable for, which materials guarantee harmlessness.
But in general, foot baths will not have electricity problems, but it does not rule out that a few products do not have strict shutdowns when they are out of the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-shaped foot bathtub when buying.
Hydroelectric separation, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take an electrical note.

Methodology refers to the study of problems through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be directly answered through perception.
Methematics is a basic law of philosophy that aims to explain the fundamental nature of being and the world.

Methodological branches include the theory of the entity, natural theology and its extensions.
The theory of the entity is to “study which words actually represent the real entity of existence, which words only represent a concept.”

It studies what kinds of moral codes people should abide by), applied ethics (applying ethical theories to the academics of actual life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.) and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing from the observed styles).
Its examination of ethics is not based on theoretical predictions, but on the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, and on all the ethical factors that have contributed to this decision, and it examines the ethical concepts held by social groups.

The name of the sheep is Jingbo, born in the year of the sheep, in the month of the sheep, on the grass of the sheep, suitable for its place, is the name of the sheep for the sheep, and is called "the uncle of the sheep."
Because of the publication of the "extraterrestrial code" series of works such as "Taiwan Authorship Record", "Indian Authorship Record", "Japan Authorship Record", "Korean Authorship Record", there is a "doubtful talent" in the industry, claiming to be "excellent in a straightforward nonsense."

The "outsiders" of Nanjing, the moon and the moon are once again opening up their secret expedition, and their lives are about to be revealed.
"Suspecting Stranger" Sheepworms whitened their hair, accumulating millions of bestselling books dedicated!
The original edition of "Chinese Odyssey", "Extraterrestrial Code", a new work, the same author, the same protagonist, continues the unfinished story of "Thailand Odyssey" and "India Odyssey"!
That’s a little bit, you’ll have a cake sauce for money.
Call the restaurant.
I just don’t want to go down and go shopping, so I’ll spend so much money on selling.
To a friend.
I sincerely thank my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the deaths of our loved ones, especially for the uninterrupted assistance that has been provided since I personally called for humanitarian assistance to my friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' elderly parents have died, and the orphans have grown into family employment.
It is your actions that help us, these families who have suffered through the most difficult moments.
Currently, the new coronavirus epidemic is erupting worldwide, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I urge you to stop the humanitarian donations to our hard-earned, the Mother of Tiananmen group, which should have long been the perfect phrase for this humanitarian rescue campaign.
I will forever remember your love, and I am convinced that your righteous conduct will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the National American Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the executives of the projects often cross.
(Apple Daily Map: Tiananmen Mother’s website is managed by the company). pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Rescue funds are often not delivered smoothly to six-four difficult hands.
In 1994, the teacher suggested the establishment of a special group of "Mother of Tiananmen" to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Six Four Orphan Education Fund, which was implemented for 11 years, and in 2009, after graduating from all Six Four Orphan Universities, the MCDF established the Six Four Orphan Special Emergency Fund, which has been implemented to date.
The funding for these projects, mainly from campus and community donations during the sixth quarter, comes from generous individual donations and is supported by the Brotherhood University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labour Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the Six-Four members finally received a donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Six-Four.
During this time, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian relief programs.
We understand that Ding teacher calls for the six-fourth donation, is for the donor consideration, we are also indeed some retired elderly, the income is not as sufficient before retirement, especially to Ding teacher's "to friends" a letter of thanks.
We will respect the decision of the hard guys to end the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those courageous colleagues who have persisted in generosity for years and risked delivering humanitarian aid.

Thank you Rabbit's review I also said that rejecting the old wind is not suitable for the old wind I didn't think the finished product came out simply too beautiful
Thanks to Dandan’s recognition, your satisfaction will keep us full of power going forward and we will continue to refuel!
This photo studio is really great and I highly recommend it to all kids!
No matter the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to the later.
The makeup artist is especially delicate, and according to your style will match up suitable for your makeup, cosmetics are also a line of large brands.
Tanya’s teacher doesn’t need to say that photography is quite a profession.
The whole studio is very artistic atmosphere, and two little cats are accompanied by play.
We are in Beijing to work, Beijing's best cinema buildings need to be in line six months in advance, colleagues have been filmed in Beijing, and watching the film felt just so.
Intentionally searched for this studio, a place with an attitude of soul.
Our face expression management is relatively poor, and I think that this is also the short version of most people, the photographer will take a shot, recording the wonderful moments of nature.
Makeup artist, photographer, late-stage designer, and a fine team.
It makes sense for us and the people around us.
It has been recommended by the girlfriend in the past, and the girlfriend just watched the sub-film is equally delighted.
Hopefully such a studio will not be buried, there will be more people who will find it, photograph it in their own style, rather than thousands of pieces.
Thank you very much for the five-star review, both of you are very thoughtful, creative new people, we are creative studios, as long as customers like us all make 200 percent effort to complete, thank you to meet.
Sweet attentive assistant, and lively photographer teacher, each person in the team are super nice a wonderful shot, difficult to forget an experience, and the effect of shooting out a lot better than I thought everyone worked hard, thank you very much.
Thank you for the comment, knowing you is also a fate from Huh and Hoot to Qin Imperial Island Our trust is so many thousands of kilometers I am happy to know you there is a chance to come back next time to Qin Imperial Island to play
How do I pay?
The meal has been returned.
No rider accepted.
The restaurant staff called me.
A small program that wants to share personal experiences.
If you intend to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you do not have this idea, it is best to study yourself, after all, the training costs a lot of money, and it will take 6 months to study.
But if you intend to get into the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good option, especially for those with self-control and their weaknesses, training is a very good option.
If your self-control is stronger, you can also choose self-study, but you will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the faculty strength is not strong enough, this training institution will have no sense, of course, some new training institutions teaching strength is not strong.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to investigate the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know exactly what this institution is, the explanation of the course is good or bad.
Hi, in fact, I do not know how to answer this question, because there is no specific introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing and the individual situation has a great relationship.
For example, the profession, the age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all depends on the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or have graduated from computer science, then if the time is enough I personally recommend self-study, this is the most efficient and cost-effective, now many offline training institutions are actually good, but the cost of study is high, the second investment time is more, basically need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I'm talking about these situations, self-learning is convenient, now many learning resources on the web are free, or go to station b there are a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a profile, get free resources, or detailed advice too.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but also can pay for a certain amount of study money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that you do not have to work hard, the teacher explains it in detail, there are questions and special answers, and also helps in the planning or supervision of learning.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, promote the position, recommend to the company after studying, so that the job search interview link can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my opinions, because I do not understand your situation, so only the introduction is not detailed, if you have other things to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said I arrived at 1am and I saw it all on the app.
What is called
I haven’t finished, what are you doing?
Personally, undertaking various (installation, cleaning, repair), wall hanging oven water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, oil smoking machine, mounting lamps, rubber glass, professional seams, household services
Thank you to those who quietly praise me, fight hard for life, life is tired but to continue.
Life will not disregard every effort, please pay attention to me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, others only see the outcome, self-support the process, face life, we are not strong, it is to continue, there is no choice, the way can look back but can not go back and forth.
Cleaning is work and duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of heart.
We do the dirtyest work, but we will take the most serious attitude to clean up every corner of the customer, see the customer's satisfied smile and the thumb, that moment all the fatigue is worth it, paying the final reward!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Carefully serve, carefully clean, and keep it beautiful.
You care about the details, Feng Shui household help you to do the "clean" I can, serving the family.
Keep the house clean, the trees home, service to the place, clean to the home.
Inside and outside, my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, but for a long time without cleaning will be dim and lightless, only after cleaning can be shining, life is also so.
Be careful how to do can succeed, with care to shape refined, beautiful sewing we are serious.
Give me the chance, it will satisfy you, the quality explains everything, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is the most encouraged!
Every business is not good at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as the attitude is serious, persistent enough, hard enough, I will be a little better than others, at least always than sitting down complaining.”
One day is counted in the morning, all the beautiful starts in the early morning I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, as you want to leave Start a new day, keep the whole day in a good mood Good morning
As a child, happiness is a thing, possession is happiness; after growing up, happiness is a goal, achieving happiness; after maturity, it is discovered that happiness is originally a state of mind, understanding is happiness.
Be the most genuine and best self, rely on it, no regrets in this life; life is one way, go its own way; life is two treasures: good body, good mood, beautiful and beautiful to live to old!
Each stage of life encounters different challenges.
Many times, it is not the ability to bind you, but the courage to face it positively.
If it is impossible to avoid it, it is better to face it openly.
The more fearful you are, the more difficulty you will be beaten down; if you meet the difficulty, the problem will eventually be solved.
Kinshasa curator joins forces to host Saudi Arabia's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art - Xinhua Network
Saudi Arabia's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art - The Diriye Contemporary Art Twin-year exhibition was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the DiriyeJAX art district in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
This two-year exhibition is jointly organized by the Saudi Diriye Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCA China Jurassic Contemporary Art Center, with UCA China Jurassic Contemporary Art Center Director Tada Zuo as the art director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "Touching the stone across the river", which metaphorizes the reform strategy adopted during the socio-economic transition, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi socio-cultural development.
The two-year exhibition, which covers 12,000 square meters, spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: “Touching the River by Stones”, “Herence as Experiment”, “Margin Thinking”, “Going to the Public”, “Beautiful New World” and “On the Spirit of Art”.
Among them, the work of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, including painting, display art and performing art in various forms; the work of 12 Chinese artists is equally concerned, and some artists use recycled materials to create in a novel way, such as Xu Ice in "The Endless Mountains behind the story series" (2014), a classic mountain water painting reconstructed with waste.
Barkley, chief executive of the Diriye Biennial Foundation, said he hoped that this year’s Biennial will establish international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi’s thriving cultural industries and creative communities, and strengthen interaction.
Tanja said: “The goal of the two-year exhibition is double, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art.”
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the two-year exhibition, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Ask clearly why.
Bone can, let the restaurant package transport.
However, the system is not very convenient, all use the other one.

Yunnan: Comprehensive regulation of rural public utility jobs management - China Network
Xinhua news agency Qingming, December 12 (reporter Lin Beijing) to continue to do well to help the employment of the population to get rid of poverty, and to consolidate the outreach of poverty alleviation achievements, Yunnan Province recently introduced a related policy to promote rural revitalization of rural utility jobs management, to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
At present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44,83 million rural utility jobs, used for the placement of rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation, and plays an important role in helping the poverty alleviated masses to employment gains, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively enhance the capacity of rural public services.
The new rules were jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and others, mainly on the target scope of grassroots recruitment of rural utility personnel, fund management, job development, and job management.
In terms of job development setting, the new rules clearly state that according to the principle of "jobs on demand, job-setting, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one-on-one, voluntary open and unified management" will be set up.
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, publication, hiring, pre-training and arrangement for entry into employment.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development department of rural public welfare jobs, the subsidy standards and methods of subsidy for rural public welfare jobs, and stipulate that rural public welfare jobs development departments should purchase accidental commercial injury insurance for rural public welfare jobs and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the issue of subsidies for rural public welfare jobs.
Address is wrong.
Hello to you.
Can cancel the order?
I ordered again.
Is it cancelled?
2, although the right in the history has a period of merit, but not long, so short is because to give a little sunlight bright, drink a little water and sweat; a little bit will have to look forward to the chief, the strike will be blown.
But in fact, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right in ending the Cultural Revolution defining the truth standards, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of politics and the protection of human rights should not be denied.
Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements, and also respect Li Weidong's person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that a revolution is not necessary, and the revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil, people's livelihoods are damaged, political groups are mixed with mud, and then foreigners are in vain.
Changing or improving China’s patience and accountability for the country’s people, political speculation attempts to fire the chestnuts, that’s not the right-wing, it’s the bastard.
Talk to the left.
The left is actually a group of times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some words of the right when necessary and analyze their thoughts, then the left will not be this, because the left is what the Communist Party wants to throw away!
Fifth, recently to see some friends on the side of the thief on the left side of the fist, is still very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Do not try to talk to the hunted and left-handed, it is a childish, unreasonable.
Do not try to prove that we are right, do not think of the anti-theft and left-wing admitting, why?
I tell my friends this way: when the anti-drug blasphemes you, when the left fist blasphemes your right dog, it proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget the ideals, or pursue the ideals, but become paranoid.
And the ideals gradually move away, even the killer dragon boy ends up being the evil dragon.
On the right I think that generally refers to constraints and freedom, China from the genes inherent in historical culture leading to China as a whole should be left-wing.
Domestic right-wing freedom, focusing on efficiency and development, left-wing to strengthen supervision, paying more attention to fairness and security.
Now society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are in conflict, and the left is positive, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Even if I don’t understand, the compliment is over.
Nothing to say, flowers are just like that.
In the past two years, the blockade and blockade of Huawei's chips has not only caused Huawei to fall into an unprecedented situation, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
U.S. pressures China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries related enterprises to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct consequences are the global chip suppliers' orders and profits are affected, causing chip manufacturing enterprises' R&D investment to decrease and production capacity to decrease, which has caused disruption in the global scope of the chip supply chain.
Today, the "deficiency of the core" has affected the world's major industries, such as car manufacturing, mobile phone price increases, almost all industries that use chips are deeply damaged.
In order to master the autonomy of the "chip", more and more countries' tech giants have begun to take the path of "decorating".
In order to firmly take control of global semiconductor control, restrict the development of China's semiconductor industry, the recent U.S. action is frequent, and hosts the "chip summit"; and also invites 64 countries giants to form a semiconductor alliance, and raise funds to support U.S. domestic science and technology giants, for example, U.S. technology giant Intel to regain the dominance in the field of chips, funds $ 20 billion in the U.S. Arizona state to build two crystal processing plants, and open up the processing business of chips.
When the majority of people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain shock to Taipei Electric, and it is likely to steal the "bowl" of Taipei Electric.
The reason for this is so certain, because Intel, as the old tech giant of Meiji, has deepened in the field of semiconductors for several decades, has a large number of talents and technical reserves, and will surely rise rapidly in the short term, defeating Taiwan.
However, for this decision of Intel, founder Zhang Zhang has disregarded.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhong said astonishingly, for the move of Intel to fund the construction of a crystalline plant, Zhang Zhong said without hesitation: Intel to build a chip generation factory, quite ironic.
Zhang's loyalty to Intel's entry into the circular field is quite disgraceful, because Zhang's loyalty to a period of complaint about Taipei and Intel more than 30 years ago is still concerned.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been a pearl in the manufacturing industry, and is the world's leader in semiconductors.
Until the 1980s, the world’s high-end semiconductor chips had been dominated by a handful of strong people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, the chip from design, manufacture to sealing was done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model leaves some small enterprises overwhelming, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs.
Under the call of market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation, in 1984, Zhang heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a specializing in design, then it could be established a factory specialized in the manufacture of circles.
Soon after, Zhang's imagination became a reality, and the power supply came into being.
Taipei Electric focuses its main business on the single link of "circular processing", does not carry out design, but only provides cutting-edge manufacturing services.
At the time, the newly founded Taiwan-based electricity, in front of this giant, Intel, was a small thorn.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang has sought to invest in Intel, but at the time that Intel heard that Taiwan accumulator only made the manufacturing link of the chip industry, obviously some self-esteem very high, can not afford Taiwan accumulator, decidedly refused to invest in Taiwan accumulator.
Zhang also believed that Intel had disregarded the crystal process service at the time.
I didn't think that the giant of crystal manufacturing services couldn't ignore at the time, but now also start to do crystal labor.
Therefore, Zhang believes that it is ironic for Intel to enter the circle.
Today, the market value of Tencent electricity has exceeded Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of Taiwan Accumulator, Intel naturally does not dare to firmly secure itself.
Nowadays, Taipei has pushed toward a 3nm chip, while Intel is still stopping at the 14nm seven years ago.
In fact, trying to overtake is not easy.
No wait.
By 19:06 it was 2 hours.
Let’s see some strange heat searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd dragon rise, good friend price rise, warrants event, public opinion spread to form a peak, then [index drop] (flat curve) finally dissipated, if there is a secondary public opinion there will be a small hammer peak again.
They look very different from the [Network Public Opinion Evolution Model] that has been shown on the website.
What is an unusual public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event, showing [Picture], [Saddle] and [Crack].
Isolated shape, that is, artificial heating, rapidly hit the list of hot searches, attracting public attention; Isolated shape, that is, cyclical heating, ensuring the theme shape of hot search list; Isolated shape, that is, collective evacuation, the hot search has played the "function", received a new task, rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of one event is exactly the valley of another event, the time is not bad in seconds, and it must be the unified batch of the navy received the task to open a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract the eye, which is responsible for the coup, which is the warfare trend, which is the shift of the eye, which affects the cognition, which is misleading judgment, which is inciting emotions, which is embroidering decisions, black production account division, node refinement operations, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, throwing away all the subjective factors of stance and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will be untouched.
Everyone who passes will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

360 integrated clothing.
Location: South Street 156 Happy Home 12th Floor
At first was a friend introduced because of the trust, so chose to look at the beginning my budget was 70,000 to do a basic renovation.
A series of scams began in the store.
I was the first time to the store just to show them my house model map, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me to say my 135 house 70,000 can be done, probably showed me a look at their materials and did not know what brand of materials they were.
Their second set of tricks is that you’ll drag your cash back as soon as you go to the store (and that money you’ll never get back once you’ve paid it, unless you have enough experience with them).
When I was hesitant about whether to make a deposit, they would invite their so-called managers to tell you how much you can give you today if you give the deposit.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being cheated, when the mind impulses, pay more than ten thousand deposits.
He offered me a lot of questions about 70,000 not including hydraulic transformation, not including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three are the main cost of the base.
In addition to these, their service fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost my confidence in the company, and without saying anything clear at first, I signed the contract.
When I went to get them back, they looked experienced and had a dedicated small team to deal with you.
Anyway, a bite to death is the problem of the customer they are not at all responsible.
Various deployment responsibilities, and a lot of details, do not want to say one by one are tears, in any case do not choose them, because my friend to find them renovated the house is also poor quality, you will be charged with various costs.
They were the former liars, and now they are transformed into great beauty, as if they were shut down again and changed to others.
So don’t choose such a foolish repair company.
After all, when choosing more than a hundred times check out these advice because the renovation is not a small money.

In the sky there is a promised twin meteor rain on the 14th to welcome great - new Chinese network
Xinhua news agency Tianjin December 12 (reporter Zhou Yuan) Astronomy Cop expert introduced that as the last massive meteor rain this year, the twin meteor rain of one of the three major meteor rain in the northern hemisphere will be great on December 14, meteor rain friends can observe in the afternoon of the day.
Beijing's astronomy enthusiast Anjing shot in the Twin Moon meteor rain on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor rain's mother bodies are cyclic comets, but the Gemini meteor rain's mother body is asteroid 3200 Fae, an Apollo-type asteroid.
Gemini meteor rain is also the second known meteor rain that is not “born” by comets.
Tianjin City Astronomical Society's director and astronomical expert, Shu Li Ping, introduced that just like the big movie, the Twins meteor rain usually appears at the end of the year, and the "upcoming archive period" can last from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor rain is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three great meteor rain in the northern hemisphere along with the symbolic meteor rain and the Anglo-Saxon meteor rain.
A remarkable feature of Gemini meteor rain is that the meteor is slower, rich in color, and there are also many fire meteor stars, suitable for both sightseeing and astronomical photography for beginners.
Tianjin City astronomy enthusiast Yang Chen shot in Tianjin, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini meteor rain will be huge at about 15 a.m. on December 14, when ZHR (the number of meteorites visible per hour when the radiation point is right above the head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor rain recommended index chart.
“Last year, the ‘colourful’ Gemini meteor rain caused a deep impression on people, but this year’s Gemini meteor rain will be disturbed by the moonlight and will be a bit discounted.
November 11th, the lunar calendar is November 14, the moon phase is full moon, bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, so that in the latter half of the night the moon will fall, at this time the meteor rain radiation point will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor rain can observe in the last few hours after the late moon, but pay attention to the cold and warm."
How can we observe as many meteorites as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a high altitude, low-light, northeast-oriented view of the spot in the suburbs or in the countryside, and then patiently wait until the moon goes down to observe.
It should be noted that the flow of Gemini meteor rain in all directions is large, and you do not need to constantly look at the radiation of Gemini meteor rain when observing.
Friends who like photography to want to shoot gorgeous 'Meteor rain large parts', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-spectrum lens, use high ISO and maximum spectrum when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries and fast door lines are also essential.”
Remember to remind.

In my understanding, what the headliner says is that traditional TV should refer to liquid crystal TV, and the difference in the positioning of laser TV and liquid crystal TV in the market is the following two points:
First, laser television is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the big screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product for the big screen.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV size is more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally more than 75 inches, the maximum is more than 100 inches, fully satisfying the needs of users for large screen color power.
In recent years, the share of shipments and sales of laser TVs in the world has been increasing, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total sales of 80 inch and above TVs.
According to Zhejiang's forecast, in 2020, the laser TV market sales growth will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye care.
Based on the image principle of laser television long reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source is not directly emitted into the eye, compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the image process is closer to the image process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also less.
China Institute of Electronics and Technology Standardization Scientific Laboratory and Beijing Consortium Hospital eye experts, through the strict contrast trial of people watching laser TV and liquid crystal TV under the same conditions, obtained 144 groups of test data.
The data confirms that laser TVs do have strong eye-protecting properties and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
In the present time when visual health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opens another breakthrough in the color electricity market.
Second, laser television is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs is currently more than 10,000 yuan, and the price is gradually rising with the upgrading of size and light source.
Why is laser television so expensive?
Surely it makes sense.
With the continuous development of the light source and the technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot.
With ultra-short focal distance projection technology, laser television projection distance is shorter than traditional projection equipment, can a 100 inch large screen experience in a short distance, the required space is not large, and the host is small, and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also feature real 4K ultra-high-definition quality, artificial intelligence systems, live screens and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking visual experience.
Don't talk about the fake demand, but the product of the demand segmentation, the quality of painting and input and output ratio, laser television is not a video player's dish, want to take into account the large screen and watch the environment is insufficient, you can try, everything is beneficial and bad, weigh after judging yourself, you are afraid to listen to the word.
Simply put, ultra wide-angle near-focus projectors – laser TVs, in order to stick close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which are not in line with the optical best design.
In order to block some environmental light, the use of micro-structure finer curtains, the cost is high, the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65-inch liquid crystal.
Another thing, I especially hated the projection manufacturer Namer reflex to the eye good this when selling point, please, the light on the curtain can see the eye is direct light for the eye, you reflect to the ceiling, the eye can not see, if the true LCD TV is also long "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, the projection curtain would not be like if it was not a long-range reflection.
Exactly being ignored by the heat patch (light patch) effect of the high-performance curtain, a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at some angle, which is really unpleasant.

Added the WeChat appointment date, Miss sent me the possible schedule, reply information in a timely manner~
Before going to see the shooting work in the store, more is the outdoor wedding dress, the shooting is beautiful, and there are a lot of shooting styles involved.
After the day came and the sister simply exchanged their ideas, very patiently helped me to try two sets of style clothes I curved, and finally decided to start makeup shapes - the photographer will put some items before shooting, will guide the action, and improve the details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate concrete shooting ideas with me, so it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be nice.
After taking a good photo, the photographer will help select photos, exchange later styles, feel very careful.
Repair takes about half a month, wait for effect.
For the second time in the photo-class hegemon dining event - most of the clothes can choose one shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the 95-year-old brother, it feels a little bit dull, hopefully in the customer's shooting action guidance after can give more advice - very good talk, the shooting process is more enjoyable.

The photographer will also teach you very seriously how to move.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to add photos.
【Experience】The shape may be a little overstated, the original two-eyed skin was placed on the three-eyed skin.
The eyebrows were also shaved, a bit embarrassing for everyday unpainting eyebrows.
The photos are given ten days, but the P-graph effect is not so satisfied, and the feeling of the two-eyed patches is still obvious.

Buy an umbrella insurance?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: in accordance with the regulations of insurance brokerage regulations (revised in 2015), to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three keywords: shareholders, initiators have no major illegal records in the last 3 years, the minimum amount of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three articles are actually very demanding, in summary, it is to have strength, to pass the approval of the State authority department of the National Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulating insurance companies, banks), shareholders to have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company small umbrella insurance, insurers do not need to question the umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not any insurance company can.
In this respect, it is good and trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies star disability insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelf and Thai Super Mary No. 5 disability insurance, the insured party and the insurer are Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, without questioning its reliability.
From the payment model perspective: Internet platform products, because of the operating costs of the business network, and the cost of business employees, so the price ratio of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payments, reduces the payment pressure of insurers, while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
This is especially important, because insurance is a very strong industry with very strong professional requirements, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of miscarriages, in health information and occupation, non-insurance workers will often add their subjective awareness when insuring, feel healthy or fit, so there is a lot of risks, there is a risk of being rejected.
I myself have done insurance phone sales at "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like the small umbrella, also the Internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real, also relied on spectrum, not relied on spectrum is people, Internet channels have no professional practitioners, there are a lot of sales misleading.
For example, $ 1 insurance guarantee, $ 6 million, buy insurance phone, free to receive 60,000 heavy disease guarantee, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid weight is light, will not tell the insurer, the first month $ 1, the next month is required to charge according to the normal, dozens to 200 different, many customers deduct a year or two of their own purchase is not clear.
Thinking that it could cost one dollar, the insurance company will pay six million dollars.
The free phone is sent by the special insurance number such as 6666, 8888 and if the prize text message is sent, it is not exchanged, and no one is reminded.
(This is another hole for insurers) free to receive 60,000 heavy disease guarantee, is a short-term, if only on this, no other commercial risk, if there is a serious disease, 60,000 can do nothing, can not solve the problem, later life begins naked.
Currently, the state is also struggling with the misleading of internet insurance sales.
So in a comprehensive view, the platform is no problem, the product is not a problem, there is a problem with the professionalism and professional practice of the businessman.
In fact, many off-line insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products have a better price ratio than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured off-line products, and saved 2000-3000 yuan per person.
If you have any doubts, welcome to contact and communicate with me.
I: Minia insurance broker, has 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serves a thousand enterprise users, cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying for insurance, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for customers, applying for insurance, for customers' goods compared to three, make every effort for customers to fight for the best nuclear insurance results, after applying for insurance, for customers to do insurance arrangement, insurance order custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer.
Hopefully my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is the insurance business of the insurer after clicking on the insurance link, can complete all the insurance processes independently.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all steps can be completed by the insurer independently.
Although internet insurance is not very "ceremonial" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contracts.
This pattern, a little like the ordinary "telephone sales" flow line task, but so buying insurance will also have a deadly problem, that is – follow-up services may not follow.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades, and when we buy insurance, should we carefully think about this "intermediary" that we choose, is it a "intermediary" that can be accompanied by us for a long time and will also provide us with services in many years?

Thanks for helping.
I have always been opposed to any form of contempt and blasphemy, much less to this type of personal assault.
In a civilized society, we can include everything, but we must eliminate this villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, we must first resist this uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending a friend request on Facebook, to the time you posted a ridiculous post, to the time you tried to post my so-called home location and my father’s name on social media, I’ve been unresponsive.
Afterwards, you intensified not only on the frequency of six meals a day, but also on Facebook and your so-called friends continued to discourage some obscene, humiliating words about me, appearance, body, good nutrition, what the strawberries in bed, if you want to insert such messages, I... also counted.
How did I know later I received several friends sending comments about your Facebook friend’s account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment content.
Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer keep silent.
After I uploaded the news to the police, you were not at all confused, but more and more upset.
No matter what political background you have, no matter what identity status you have, there is a need for gender respect in our society.
Yes, you can continue to make ridiculous, obscene, humiliating, insulting statements, you can continue to say you just care and care about me, you can continue to think it’s not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it’s not yours, or you can continue to make all the aggressive statements.
Yes, I cannot, nor can I, stop you.
I do not know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and body do not need your commentary.
I don’t even think there would be a girl willing to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I say yes, you won’t believe it either.
I don’t think any girl can say she’s fine after being bullied so much.
Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who don’t even have basic virtues choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I sent a message to all of you to criticize.
No one can pretend to be yourself.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.

The most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 Dover pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional report: China-US relations latest news: the latest satellite images show that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. naval arsenal rarely visited Guam, releasing important signals to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea strategic trend perception platform, on January 9, the satellite discovered the U.S. aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" near the Barrabac Strait.
The Strait of Barrabac, which connects the South China Sea and the Sea of Soros, is a strategic site on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier is deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Fish Eagle" shipping aircraft.
The U.S. aircraft carrier, in addition to the Carl Vinson, and the USS Abraham Lincoln, departed from the United States on January 3.
For the first time, the Lincoln also carried the F-35C fleet, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the U.S. Navy.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier stationed in Yokohama, Japan.
The aircraft carrier combat group also includes the missile cruiser "Shanpuran Lake" and the missile destroyer "Stockdar".
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea strategic trend perception platform released the latest satellite images, showing the three U.S. military aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
U.S. aircraft carriers gathered around China The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. military ship-carrying aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
According to CNN reports on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal rarely visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday.
U.S. aircraft carriers gathered around China with the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam, analysts said, sending a signal to allies and enemies in the growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
It is the permanent island of China in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam reinforced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the U.S. capacity, flexibility, combat readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as “Boomer submarines.”
The trajectory of the U.S. Navy’s 14 “Thrill Submarines” is usually kept strictly secret.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine has made the “Thrill Submarine” the “most important survival weapon of the nuclear trio”, a system that also includes launching well ballistic missiles located in the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26 percent drop in Meta, the market value evaporated to $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded “facing unprecedented competition,” why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially a advertising company, the revenue comes mainly from advertising, and advertising companies that make money today, themselves have traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on, regardless of the location, are all Meta’s traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many apps outsourcing Meta ads through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple’s privacy policy now is user-friendly and will clearly tell users whether or not to allow the app to access their information, and most people’s normal response is definitely not permitted.
Next, if Google strikes another blow, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain how high, but it does exist).
Everybody knows that Meta does not have a business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that do maritime business in China.
Meta’s offices in Hong Kong are about a few hundred, with several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of the main competitors to Meta, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from byte.
Domestic agents are helping bytes to Meta to advertise, and the performance of Meta China is also good.
I haven’t specifically understood it lately, but it won’t be better than before.
The phase of massive money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is unsuccessful.
Facebook is getting older and the new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don’t just look at the average income, but more importantly, how it looks for the future.
Obviously, Meta’s expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talks about the “ancient universe.”
The Ancient Universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the Ancient Universe is relatively long, and this story in these two or three years should not be enough to support the market value of Meta.
So the next two years should be a more difficult time for Meta.
