Students play leading roles in Zhejiang University academic annual meeting; the results are eye-opening-Xinhua
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were praised last night.
The principal researchers of these results are students, whose research has covered major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, healthcare, life sciences, and humanistic education. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: your home health examiner
Zhang Diming's team, a PhD student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone, which is half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to breathe out lightly, and this device can detect the health condition of the body from the composition of the air you exhale."
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone. After exhaling, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets available on the market that can detect health status typically measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The new biosensor uses graphene as a target material. Its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the body's health status in a more profound and precise way.
Smart surgical lights: the high-energy eyes of doctors
Besides smartphones, smart lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of graduate students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronics Sciences and Engineering opened up new ideas for the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
“The early detection and ineffective resection of many diseases are related to the lights used in doctors’ operating rooms.”
Shen Junfei said that if the doctors can not see all tumor tissues in time during initial examination of cancer for example, the cancer cells may spread afterward.
This smart surgical lamp has four light panels that can improve the differentiation of different tissues under illumination through adjusting spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness rate of the light spot at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This type of smart operating lamp has been trialled in hospitals such as the Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and received good feedback.
The invention won first prize at the National Challenge Cup in October last year.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, using at most some soap or liquid hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other classmates invented a “air handwashing device”.
Once we stand on the bathroom sink, our body weight compresses the air.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms fluid at the faucet, where it combines with the water.
In this way we can wash our hands clean!”
Experiments on color reaction and bacterial residue proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only has to rely on our own gravity as driving force, which can ensure cleaning and save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the second global Grand Challenges summit, this invention came to the fore among many top universities in the world and received the only gold award.

OK, now there is trouble
One certificate that I think is very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I find important besides a driver's license!
To popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue efforts when an emergency occurs, that is, before an ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when emergency aid is needed.
If I do suffer a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, we have only four minutes to our life, four golden minutes!
The people around us know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of just standing there motionless. It's terrifying to feel helpless.
"In China, our official data says there is three million people dying by accident every year, the most dangerous form of which is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% of people can be rescued.
In the casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, 70 to 80 percent can be saved, compared with less than 1 percent in Shanghai and Beijing.”
This is what Lu Le, a founder of First Response, said.
If a person suffers cardiac arrest with no breathing and/or heartbeat, pinching on the person will have no effect.
It is necessary to use artificial respiration and chest compressions to be able to save people.
I found that few of us have the awareness to learn first aid when something happens, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
It might even save someone’s life!
You can apply for the first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture records the goal that I will accomplish before the age of 25. Adding first aid certificate to the goal list only happened a few months ago, but it has definitely been accomplished!
Next I have to go to test for other certifications. I plan to go for a diving license. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu. It seems I also need the first aid certificate before I can go for the test. In fact, the first aid certificate is very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of them has shrimp dumplings for RM13!?

#PRS_ORG# missed delivery of food yesterday so this time I just got a shrimp dumpling!?
Because obviously I saw that it was valid when I entered the code before
Let me start with the conclusion. I personally think "The Four Seas" is a lousy film in all aspects, in every sense.
But if you're saying that there aren't any bright spots in the film, at least the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad films, one makes you sleep soundly in the cinema, and another makes you feel indignant after watching. To the audience, "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han really is exceptionally talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creature from a computer novel, it is indescribable and has many loopholes like the windbreaker on Brother Ma.
After watching it, you will wonder if there is any metaphor implied by the director, but when you think more about it, it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly describe some of the situations that I find it hard to understand.
The protagonist resides in a small island in the south, and lives with his grandma.
Her grandma had a wish to see snow and then arrange for an uncle in her neighborhood to drive her to the north-east to see the snow in a minivan.
Senior people watch the snow from South to Northeast in a van
He and his father were extremely reassured about this.
Then this old man just stopped talking.
How did his brother-in-law get a business license when he opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the motorcycle punks on the island block off a stretch of mountain road so quickly??
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver of the truck could not be found anywhere all around.
The use of this prop is just too obvious.
Why would a young scoundrel who has insufficient credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why not report to the police when facing loan sharks, the cop in the film also specifically asked whether there was a problem?
How can an adult know how to use a smartphone yet not know how to open the door with the key card at the hotel, then forcefully arrange for the owner to sit outside the door of the room to sleep all night?
There are such inexplicable episodes that pervade the film and are so outrageous that it becomes painful for me to remember them.
In addition to the plot, what’s even worse is the movie’s theme, or relatively nothing at all, that of a detestable-looking seamstress.
At the beginning of the film, you think that he wants to make a comedy, but after approximately 20 minutes you suspect it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through you think it might be a年底
For most people, it is very familiar with the rhetoric of various types of films. For example, if you want to film a motorcycle rider, just use inspirational and comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie can become successful step by step.
If you want to make romance movies, then you need to be honest about tensions between a young guy in a small town who likes to ride motorcycles, and a woman who is a waiter.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot must not contain anything that is inconsistent with the normal world.
(Like the character promoted by Yin Zheng whose new motorcycle had just been burned, and is still able to sing), it is impossible to generate brain holes that even Kennedy couldn’t separate himself from.
As for the heroine who is obviously not retarded but acts like a 5-year-old kid in some aspects, I don't know if this is because of her acting skills or the director's request.
There is another point I don't understand, why Han Han is so inclined to include crash examples in his own films as a race car driver?
Is it aimed at creating congestion for viewers when such a movie is scheduled in the Spring Festival?

Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Introduction to Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well block making equipment, inspection well block machinery and well wall module machinery in China, ranging from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, the company now has high-quality products and mainly produces hydraulic, movable and fully automated inspection well equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Check well concrete module production and processing equipment features and advantages of Zhengzhou well brick module manufacturing plant:
Yixin inspection well block machine equipment is widely applicable to new construction materials of municipal underground structures such as coal, thermal power, water, electricity and gas.
For example: various inspection wells in drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater inlets, ditches, septic tanks, small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules for building inspection wells is that the modules have concave-convex grooves on both sides, and the combined masonry is connected to form chainlocks.
The shear resistance of the well wall is far superior to that of flat-friction masonry construction.
The modules are hollow in structure. After the composite building is completed, longitudinal and horizontal holes are connected. After placing the cores, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which acts as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are provided with reinforcement grooves both vertically and horizontally. The horizontal and vertical reinforcement bars increase the overall structural strength accordingly.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking and leaking, and are characterized by stable mechanical properties, easy operation and standard forming dimensions.
It is equipped with data input and output devices, touch-type LCD display to monitor the whole process of machine operation, to realize the ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnostics system.
The mechanical hydraulic system in the well wall module adopts a single cylinder hydraulic pressure and transportation and a twin cylinder hydraulic pressure and transportation.
The independent integrated hydraulic station avoids the influence of the vibration of the main engine on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The closing of the storage box door and the automatic conveying of the shelves are all independently completed by hydraulic system, so as to reduce the mechanical wear and tear and the maintenance.
The production of concrete blocking machines adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, and hydraulic components for sealing parts to ensure stable and reliable overall performance of the equipment.
The vibration-exciting platform for well wall module is made of integral steel plate, with no welding point. This makes the stuffing box freely swing and guide, and can fully reduce the mechanical wear.
It minimizes mold load, and uses two-in-one packing to reinforce amplitude band, employing integrated and fully synchronized table vibration and mold vibration to ensure the effect of vibration.
The well wall module has mechanical vibration excitation and automatic computer control, and the amplitude adjusts itself according to the cost-effectiveness of raw materials, to prolong the lifetime and reduce costs.
The well wall modules may have dual functions of automatic mechanical control and manual control.

Chongqing vocational schools are experimenting with modern apprenticeship system
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, the city will trial the "modern apprenticeship based" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools, and students who have received the trial training will also have apprenticeship status.
The municipal education commission requests that secondary vocational school enrollment and enterprise employment procedures should be standardized, and that apprentices should have double identities of vocational school students绕
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt modern apprenticeship and work with cooperative enterprises to carry out pre-employment and transfer training for their employees.
Pilot schools should reform their talent training modes.
Schools and enterprises shall jointly design talent cultivation programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, management standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program functions as a trial period, in which the student's internship period at the enterprise is determined according to the professional personnel training plan. The working experience on the post is usually 6 months.
According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead two to five apprentices to form study groups, making sure that students learn the skills required by each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with around 50 personnel in each pilot project, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
Based on the principle of implementing pilot projects first, then moving forward step by step, we have explored and established a long-term mechanism featuring joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated education among schools and enterprises. These will effectively enhance students’ job skills, and improve their counterpart employment rate and job quality.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission but most cases are mild
Many South African scholars and medical experts believe that the mutated coronavirus, Omicron, causes milder symptoms than the delta variant although it spreads faster.
A group of more than 5,000 physicians formed in South Africa’s Gauteng province reported that patients they currently treat have mild symptoms, such as body pain and coughs, much like the flu, according to The Associated Press.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day but none of them have yet required hospitalization.
“They were able to manage the disease at home and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days of being quarantined,” Pillay said.
This includes elderly patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more at risk to become seriously affected by coronavirus, he said.
By comparison, he said during the last Delta virus outbreak, the patients he treated with the virus had "difficulty in breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a matter of days.”
In the two weeks after the first reports of the mutated Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will still be several weeks before enough data is gathered, observations from doctors and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of patients hospitalized in recent weeks with coronavirus are severe cases, half of that of the previous outbreak. The average length of stay has shortened from 8 to 2.8 days. Only 3% of recent coronavirus patients have died, compared with 20% in the early outbreak of cases in South Africa.
"At present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: “It’s still early days and we need to get data in later days.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur relatively late and we're only two weeks into this wave.”
In the meantime, scientists across the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's predominant strain of coronavirus, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicentre of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases identified in the first week of December, with tests showing the omicrone variant comprising more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Thanks to all of today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given out!

Education Times Review: What can I do to save abducted children?
If we use the analogy of the famous saying of “No buying, no killing”, then, in a magnificent environment where there is no demand for “abduction”, mass prevention and fight against abductions by all people will make trafficking unprofitable, with high risks and high costs, and then this type of crimes will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the platform for emergency release of information on missing children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish authoritative channels for the release of information on missing children and for timely retrieval of abducted children.
When I heard this App named "Reunion", I felt a lot of warmth immediately.
New technologies are not only full of sense and inspiration in their names, but also can embody the prudent application of informatization in a practical and effective manner.
The primary goal of enforcement of the law against abduction is to retrieve the kidnapped children and to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The next step is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment to social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated in many “big words”.
Before abduction and trafficking cases are solved, however, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
For the urgent purpose of “search for help,” many controversial topics, such as “whether abducting children should be condemned to death”, can be put aside temporarily, and they can be discussed with caution; but the rescue of the kidnapped children cannot wait.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leave a crime location as soon as possible after they have succeeded.
If the kidnapping operation delays one minute longer, the child may be further separated from its parents and the difficulty in solving a case will increase by one degree.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective approaches like the “Reunion” platform that will directly help detect cases and retrieve children.
After all, “inhibiting abduction” is a major task that requires the functioning of the entire legal system.
The improvement of legislation, judicial protection and rigorous law enforcement in combating crime and protecting the rights and interests of the children and their parents require “caring for the young and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, both at home and in society, could be done better.
For example, a common case is a family of three resting in a train station, and the parents were asleep and woke up to find that the child was missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old to possess adequate self-protection skills, but as a parent of younger children, at least a fair degree of protection should be achieved.
Taking breaks for both parents, or keeping children under secure protection, are the minimum means of preventing child abductions.
From the perspective of the police's fight against abduction and trafficking, the side that buys kidnapped children should also be paid attention and punished.
A single unlawful act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions in China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for child trafficking is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may include death and property confiscation.
Under the general trend of “light punishment”, the crime of abduction and trafficking of children is clearly a offence with heavier punishments.
Yet, there are still many cases of human trafficking that happen every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts about raising children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this part of the people should be followed up simultaneously
In order to effectively control human trafficking crimes, officials cannot rely solely on strict enforcement of the law.
If there is a widespread "market" for abduction and traffickers, they will continuously innovate their tactics to induce a fight against law enforcement. The campaign to prevent the abduction will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Thus, eradicating outdated concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eliminate the crime of kidnapping, selling and bribing children.

International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oils into two categories, including Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil.
Virgin olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil that is obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold-pressing and filtering to remove foreign materials.
Depending on the acidity levels, it is classified into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade and quality olive oil, which is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent with pleasant and light botanical aromas and an acidity of less than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil has a slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, and tastes pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are OK and the acidity does not exceed 3.3 %.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity greater than 3.3%, or as “secondary oil”.
Refined olive oil can be classified into two categories:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain percentage of virgin olive oil to balance taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is transparent and pale golden in color.
Refined Olive Oil or Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Refined olive oil obtained from the oil residues and purified by the dissolution method.
Anyone who has seen the classifications should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know that olives are just like wine grapes, and olives from different producing areas and varieties will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best places to grow olive oil are:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growing of olive oil, including temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
In locations except the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas in the region (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., have similar climatic conditions as in Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on.
The picking months for olives are:
From March to June each year, the olive tree blooms and bears fruit. The fruits begin to develop and mature between July and October. The fruits transition from green to red, purple and finally black.
The season for harvesting fruit is from November to February (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linseed acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable for human nutrition of the oils found so far
Summit on democracy ended and Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and an authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he planned to hold a second global democracy summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political councilor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: “We know just how tough the job ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can meet that challenge because, as I've said before, democracy is everywhere, as this summit has demonstrated.
Autocracies can never extinguish the flickering fire of freedom which is burning in the hearts of people worldwide and in all corners of the earth.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and drive reforms for transparent and accountable governance, one that is more resilient to authoritarian buffers and shocks and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
The main themes on the second day of the Democracy Summit included defending human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with “International Human Rights Day”.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including exploiting all the tools afforded by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong-based pro-democracy and human rights activist Eric Law spoke to the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants of the ongoing concern regarding human rights conditions in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
“For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without putting in place a mechanism to hold it accountable,” he said.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use whatever [resources] we have to ensure the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China (CCP).
"Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you do not recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.”
Taiwan’s executive council member, Tang Feng, published a “National Statement” via video and emphasized that Taiwan is in the forefront of opposing autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the coronavirus outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when democracy in Taiwan is just emerging, we remain a firm leader in the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights worldwide," the president said.
We are seeing signs of retreating democracy around the world as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights abuses in the name of public health and collective good.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without shutting down our cities, and we can defeat false information without removing them.”
On the second day of the Democracy Summit, the US Treasury Department announced legally the sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries including China and North Korea that had been identified as violating human rights.

Hello, the chicken with saliva delivered by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep going, so I want to find a trainer at a similar price first.
Unfriendly. In fact, prices are usually proportional to the friendliness, and if they cannot be distinguished, the normal case is the expensive ones are more friendly than the cheap ones. This type of "entry camera" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low intensity, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is so big that a hard ball could not stand up, making it difficult to handle even for advanced players.
The logic and subtext of their existence is—Tennis is so hard. If you know that you can’t learn it, you may not be willing to buy expensive stuff. To fool you by making cheap things, if you play twice, you wouldn’t play again.
When you really can tell what is good from bad, it means you have made progress. Then I will buy expensive products and I will earn twice the money.
It is suggested to spend a similar price to play a better second-hand racket, and choose from Prince or Dunlop. The two brands don’t have much reputation, and good rackets are not sold for high prices. New ones will cost just 500 or 600 yuan, and used ones are 200 yuan.
It seems friendly for novices, but becomes useless once past the newbie stage. But most people, especially girls, won’t make it past the novices stage.

In fact, there is a lot of attention paid to dressing and matching of girls with fat body.
The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. They should be almost around the knees and just enough to cover the fat areas on the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a sense of being short and fat.
If you wear it into three sections (upper, middle and lower), it looks like you naturally increase in height, and you will look taller if your upper body, skirt and stockings are of different colors.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for the fat girls (I fully understand this), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat. Elegant black skirts are also the first choice for fat girls.
Wearing darker colored clothing, especially short black skirts, can make you appear thinner.
If your calves are very fat, don't wear them too conspicuous in your socks and shoes.
The more popular it is the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
It prevents people from getting the feeling of being fat when people pay attention to your legs and feet
For girls who are slightly overweight, they must be taught the tips for properly dressing and matching.
If the legs are thick, they must wear black stockings or mesh socks (fine-plaided kind). Choose a flabby print skirt with a soft texture and a top with a swing collar to cover up the deficiencies of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are particularly particular about wearing short skirts.
Fat girls who wear short skirts, should choose a top that is in the same color as the skirt, which will increase the height of your fat figure.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs appear longer and it's the perfect match in summer!
If you are a woman with a fat upper body but thin legs, we recommend choosing a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it will also show your advantages.
A-line skirts will make you look thinner, and suitable for fat girls. The tops should be tighter to form an even more layered look.
A simple white T-shirt is paired with a short skirt, and fat ladies can also try it.
Fat girls are also able to wear fashionable clothes.
As long as they can master the rules of dressing and matching, little fat girls will also be the focus of attention.”
After some changes with regard to clothing, people should also exercise more in their lives and strive for breaking away from the label of fat girls sooner rather than later😄

Girl used as an archery target to raise money for her sister: “It will be OK if I imagine it's a skin injury” - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to serve as a "target" for her sister to collect donations" exploded in their circles of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a larger wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square with words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" written on the board, indicating that the passersby can use bow and arrow to shoot, after payment.
This behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity officer from the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News that the police had made such radical actions after they believed that the girl was raising money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth encouraging. After being cautioned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
A school girl was admonished to collect donations from street “target”
In the images uploaded on the Internet, a girl with long hair was standing in front of a large wooden board with a font of “a”.
The image sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "begging behavior that attracts attention", and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
“We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the plaza at around 10 am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a number of onlookers at that time.”
In an interview with local media, policemen from Tianshui police station near the incident said that there are two girls in the shop; they are both around 20 years old and are beautifully dressed.
One of the girls was crying, and begging passerby to play this game; a girl said, "My friend's sister was diagnosed with leukemia, and is urgently needing surgery, please help."
“We got in contact with local police in Guizhou and learned that this girl was raising donations for her sister’s leukemia treatment.”
Last night, a publicity officer from Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from The Beijing News that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, this action was done because the treatment still cost over 300,000 yuan and we could not think of a good way to raise donations for the time being.
He said that one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for the attack, but they were not involved in the whole process, and no one was found shooting any arrows. Some people were watching and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
The police identified the use of bows and arrows by the public security departments were not in the regulated scope.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate the use of this kind of online donation-raising method".
After being warned by people at the police station, she has already left the police station.
Cooling effect: good. Thinness: convenient. Appearance and material: satisfactory. Acer has always been very cost-effective.
The new machine is very good.
It has stable performance, there is no trouble dissipating heat from the four air outlets, it is worthy of recommendation
The Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming notebook is pretty good, it has plenty of workmanship and materials, rest assured of the brand!
The Acer Shadowknight Dragon is not that expensive in terms of price.
Personally think Acer Shadow Knight is great. The performance of the game is very comfortable. You can play most games freely and my FPS is stable and smooth. The game is good lol.
Heat dissipation: The heat dissipation effect is good. The fan is powerful enough for use in quiet working mode, and the fan is quite suitable for gaming.
Material: The appearance is quite cool, and the game is well-made. Display effect: The screen is very clear, and it is enough for playing games in 1080.
It looked ok if I bought a notebook because it's mainly used for designing and has a very high cost performance.
I started using Acer Dark Knight 2 years ago, after two years of use, the cost-effectiveness is relatively high, and the quality is excellent!
I also recommend to the friends around me to buy this product!
So far, 3 machines in this series have already been purchased!
It looks nice and the configuration is also very good
Bought this for my nephew. I wanted to wait for the Bank 418 event, but because of urgent need, I purchased it ahead of time. It was a pity that I didn’t catch up on the event.
But the price/performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics is very fast, so I will check back in some time
Brand new, very cost effective gaming laptop with good design. Windows 11 and office 2019 are already installed
Display: I bought this PC for 3D rendering for children, and the software has already been installed. The child said it can be used with no problem. The computer performance is fine for 3D design work.
I bought this for my son and he said it was good.
The computer is pretty good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, it is okay to ask if you don't understand, I recommend buying
This is all very well, the quality of the game is very good
What will be the hottest stuff in 2021?
It is without a doubt the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, a very popular political article wrote "Look! project managers can match gold medals for Olympic events". It mentioned that project managers could follow the lead in several projects.
This seemingly joking article also shows the daily bitterness of project managers, which reflects their inability to cope with the current project management.
Those engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to use some actions to extricate themselves from the predicaments in the workplace.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professionals) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to enhance their project management capabilities.
According to the “20 Years Development Report of Project Management China (1999-2019)”, as of September 2019, there had been nearly 600,000 PMP® applicants across China, 420,000 people who passed the PMP® certification, and approximately 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the worldwide total.
In the past ten years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year, which means that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience". The changing working environment gave us the ability to learn and explore the way forward on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can the PMP test be enough to guarantee the smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners reported that they could systematically master the ten major areas and five process groups in project management through learning PMP/IPMP and other relevant courses, but there was still confusion when it came to actually doing project management.
Many project executives often report the following problems: Lack of project management understanding and independent experience, not knowing how to put the project management theory into practice; lack of a systematic role in project management procedures and systems, inability to enable implementation during work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delays in projects;
So, with more than ten years of focus on product innovation and R&D management, CNTIC has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers.
“R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp” is an online course of fragmented learning which combines practical cases, tools and methods from many R&D companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard activities of project managers and embark on an advanced project management path.
This is also an opportunity for companies to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operating results for enterprises.
You can see what the other students say about this course first. This course is explained in simple terms by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (the former Huawei research and development management team), combining the international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known companies.
In addition, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform and apply learned content to specific work after class.

Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of Double Twelve - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
The transaction volume of online payment business across China reached 1.77 trillion yuan during this year's "Double Eleven" carnival, hitting a new high compared to previous years.
On one hand, some people sigh that the consumption force of citizens has become stronger; On the other hand, they must calmly consider how consumerism will affect society and the current mainstream consumers.
On the eve of the “Double Twelve”, Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Home Credit) advocated rational consumption, reminding users, especially the young people, to foster good consumption awareness and habits and refuse to spend blindly and excessively.
The survey on consumer financial literacy published this year by the People's Bank of China found that the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, a 2.04-point increase compared to 2019.
In general, Chinese residents are performing well in terms of financial consumption, but there are huge differences in financial behaviors and skills, and further enhancement of basic financial knowledge is necessary.
The elderly and young people have a relatively low financial literacy level and will remain the focus of financial education. Nielsen’s “Report on the Status of Young People Debt in China” and the “2019-2020 Young People’s Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance showed that the young generation has enormous consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Half of them have no debt accumulation.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has always dedicated itself to providing high-quality and caring services to help people build their own happy lives, advocated consumer awareness of consumption and responded positively to regulatory calls to take action to enhance consumers, especially young people's awareness of rational consumption.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously implemented a variety of diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including university students, and has also taken a subtle approach to guide the consumption needs of young people in a variety of ways. It helps them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan their consumption needs, and helps them accumulate life wealth.
When Double Twelve comes, Home Credit reminds all consumers to have a reasonable consumption awareness and correct outlook on money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings about consumer loans so as not to affect personal credit and economic living in the future.
Be sure to plan ahead when making purchases and repay your payments on time according to your ability.
Overdue information will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse impacts on economic life such as car purchasing and housing purchases in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verify whether relevant institutions have operating credentials.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products, to provide consumers with more suitable and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, and help consumers develop rational consumption.

NDO: GCC meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, it is the first visit by Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017 which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties and imposed a blanket embargo on Qatar amid the crisis, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity within the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked air, sea and land routes to Qatar
The crisis was only resolved at the GCC summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards “solidarity and stability”.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors from both countries in Qatar.
Resolving differences among Gulf Arab countries to restore relations with Qatar stems from a demand for unity to address common challenges in the interests of countries and regional stability.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land route between the two neighboring Gulf countries.
The 725 km-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and integrate supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The visit by the Saudi crown prince to Gulf countries coincides with Iran negotiating with world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as JCPOA, an agreement that Gulf Arab states condemned as failing to resolve the missile issue with Tehran.
Various Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threatre to regional security".
Various Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and inaction to curb Iran’s activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran amid the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf nations in their nuclear negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to contain escalation in tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that are slowing down economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first meeting of GCC countries since a dispute between some member states with Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, and to propose measures that make its member countries fully cooperate with each other in meeting common challenges and contributing towards the stability and development of the Gulf states.

It's known as the largest exhaust noise from supercars in New Mountain Area!
This car brought to you by our team is the dream of many people!
This is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the replacement for Murcielago — the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly RM23 million, the yearly road tax is more than 1000RMB, and it has 4 wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Since it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, so it seems like my myvi just gets to 30km/h when others reach 100km/h. Well.
Low body, glass front doors, large air intakes all around the body and 6.5 V12 engine clearly seen under the glass are the perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself and I have compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It is too much attention, everybody is watching wherever I go, and I am very uncomfortable! (Actually, it is cool)
Gas cost is around RM1 per 1km (the owner does not care at all)
Getting in and out of the car requires some practice, otherwise it will be awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway)
The engine noise is so loud that I'll go deaf immediately after getting off the car. (It's still cool, though)
The vehicle is too big, so it is very narrow to park in a normal parking space, and I am afraid that a car next door will knock on it when the door is opened!
I am a little lonely because there is no opponent on the road (I say it myself, it has nothing to do with the owner of the car, haha)
Don’t get me wrong, the supercar in this video is NOT for sale, sorry!
Anyone who wants to shoot a video for their car, welcome to contact us!
For more car information that you don't know about, you can find it in The Car Guide / People's Auto Magazine
Involved in accident worth thousands of dollars
I believe all drivers all know about Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911, Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world and Porsche 911 is also worth over a million dollars!
A few days ago, a million 911 sports cars and 10 million Chiron supercars were knocked down in a few minutes in the same country!
Looking at the results, this is justified!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times on the same frequency-Xinhua News Agency
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and values that have been accumulated for a long time in the development process of a institution, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to today, the university spirit has been essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first university in the modern sense in the world, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. Chinese universities arose during a time of national crisis and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the values of “fine virtue, social justice and peace,” and the patriotic responsibility to “revive science and strengthen our country.”
Currently, the trend toward informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. Global competition in education, technology and talent has intensified. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the "Overall Plan for Coordinating the Development of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" preserves China's confidence and determination to be a country with higher education, and it also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How can we endeavor to become one of the world's first-class bodies in a relatively short time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, with certain gaps still there?
Apart from its confidence in goals, paths and ability, higher education institutions should fully utilize three advantages: firstly, they can play respect to the latecomers, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, to greatly improve their academic level and quality of their education; secondly, cultural advantages are to inherit the wisdom and connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization over the past five thousand years, carry forward great traditional culture, to build strengths, build brands and enhance their image; thirdly, the system advantage: exercise the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen goal driving, pool consensus and synergy, optimize the allocation of resources, and provide a sustainable way for schools to super Institutionalize the advanced world level in order to meet the world leading level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in one form, and all schools must manifest their individuality and characteristics while taking advantage of their strengths.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have Chinese characteristics in common, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we emphasize three characteristics in running a school: first, to highlight the innovative and entrepreneurial talent development characteristics, building a comprehensive educational environment incorporating the integration of science and education and school-enterprise fusion, and to form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, to highlight the characteristics of intersecting and converging disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively cultivate intersecting emerging disciplines and iconic crossover achievements; third, highlighting the characteristics of university running system and social services, and establishing in-depth exchanges and cooperation between industries, universities, and research institutes, accelerating the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is especially important that we always adhere to the university spirit and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of “Seeking truth and innovation”, common values of “Restraints, practicing morality, discernment, and steadfastness” together form the latest system of expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction, continue to accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual power. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
“Hina Janghe" emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, which embodies the big-hearted values "people in the world can use it for me", and is reflected as the high quality concept of running a school and educating people in the world.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the essence of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of academic operation.
"The intelligent hears the silent, and the enlightened see痕迹 the invisible."
Chinese universities should further focus on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the current position of higher education and the historic mission shouldered by it, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanities and freedom. We should let the spirit of the university encourage others to produce greater national prosperity and revitalization, as well as to realize the common ideal of mankind.

At a time when NFTs were quickly out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic started to earn steady income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology. It integrates multiple gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction value, having exceeded US$3 billion so far.
Data from TokenTerminal shows that Axie Infinity’s daily operating income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to that of “Honor of Kings”.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
With the use of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player. Apart from having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game and its ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
First I got an industry that has much room to grow, at least a market size of RMB 100 billion; secondly, I have to choose注意 future growth industries, and consider the sectors where the growth will be at its best after 3-5 years; finally, we should choose the industries that have policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the stage of industry development, and whether the track is flat or rough refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to “do the things right,” which means just doing things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which means doing what's the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, while tactics are in implementation. There is room for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it can be considered when deepening in the current field
Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021 after 12 years of its existence.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated bitcoin as legal tender. This is the first time bitcoin has become the legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, SEC approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it in the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to enter the United States capital market, expanding cryptocurrency investment exposure once again.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin isn't the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Very reputable seller with excellent service attitude.

I thank the photographer and makeup artist for providing me with a unique wedding photo.
Thank you to all the staff who took wedding photos today, and we are looking forward to the release of the finished film.
Taking wedding photos can be a physically demanding activity, especially for photographers, who run and jump.
The makeup artist was very considerate in helping me design a makeup that suited my face shape. The photographer was humorous when taking pictures, which was worthy of praise.
Thanks to my photographer and makeup artist I get to see myself as beautiful as I have been in my lifetime.
The woman has beautiful eyes and a decent appearance. At first glance, she looks like a good wife and mother. She will be diligent and thrifty in the future.
The groom is regarded as having earned it. He will live a happy and harmonious life.

The most important aspect of shooting wedding photos is that photographers and makeup artists are both aesthetically aligned. Fortunately, I have encountered them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I found out that I was also a “liar”.
Asian American groups file complaints against Yale and three other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, reported on May 23 that more than 130 Asian-American groups in the US filed complaints with the US Department of Education and Justice in protest against the discrimination of Asian American applicants by three prestigious Ivy League schools in Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which had raised the complaint, held a press conference in Washington that day.
In the last 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of American elite universities has doubled, but in these three leading American schools, the percentage of Asian Americans has remained basically the same.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges “persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants” in their so-called “universal” admissions processes.
A research conducted by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in the three universities, Asian people have the lowest admission rate of any ethnic group relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown and Dartmouth have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian-American students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to investigate the matter and take steps to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in admissions after a complaint is filed.
They also expect that the colleges receiving complaints will take the initiative to take this issue into consideration and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities involved in the complaint have not yet responded.
Founded in 2015, the Asian American Education Alliance lodged a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, those involved in this complaint also include educational groups from Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani individuals in the United States.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agency about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu discussed the details of purchasing the factory building with a family member of the owner, Lin, and remitted 200,000 yuan via bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
It is stated that "If the purchaser wants to purchase the plant, the deposit will come back to the seller; if the seller is not willing to sell the plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the two sides agree to sign an agreement on the construction of the plant within one week."
However, the two parties have failed to reach consensus on major contract terms, such as the scope of plant sales and mode of payment. This resulted in a delay in signing the property sale contract.
Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After finally paying a deposit and ready to fully purchase the house, I was just about to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell it, which caused Mr. Lu to be helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu brought a suit against Lin to the Yuyao City People’s Court.
After hearing the hearing, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract and the responsibility could not be attributed to the defendant alone.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Attorneys remind】 The customer must exercise the necessary duty of prudence and care in the process of transaction.
When signing a contract, buyers must perform the required prudential obligations, such as verifying information about the property owners, whether the property is occupied or not, and specifying the date and place of delivery in the contract, to prevent any disputes during contract performance.
(Deutsche Welle) China’s foreign ministry spokesman said Saturday (December 11) that in a statement after the “Democracy Summit” concluded, the U.S. is "drawing lines with ideology and instrumentalizing and weaponizing democracy, turning it against the reality of democracy, inciting division and confrontation and diverting domestic conflicts in the name of fake democracy."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and belief on others, implemented 'democratic reform', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions and initiated a 'color revolution', with devastating results."
'Democracy' has long since become a 'weapon of mass destruction' used by the United States to interfere with other countries.
The summit is a move by Biden to deliver on his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting, conducted by video link, was attended by leaders of 111 countries in the world, including leaders from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the US for issues with democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically, there are also skeptical voices who criticize the leaders of some countries with authoritarian tendencies, like those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration has organized its summit not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
Newly-appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the Digital Democracy Summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday that "the American-style democracy is pathological today, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social separation, racial conflicts, and polarization between rich and poor becoming more and more serious". Democracy in the United States is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in a speech, “As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and become more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good.”
He stresses that democracy is not something taken for granted: "We must constantly renew it across every generation, which in my opinion is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said democracies around the world “need fighters to defend as there are ongoing and worrisome challenges to democracy and human rights.”
The United States has pledged to launch a yearlong effort following the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news outlets.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improving their democratic institutions ahead of a physical democracy summit scheduled in late 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on progress we've made through the next year."

Richang Restaurant (Wudaokou Branch)
[Mint] Environment: Moderately acceptable [Service Bell] Service: the food is served quickly [Kufa mara cake] is my must order. The mala cake is too fragrant and soft...
Food is delicious, meat is good, and service is friendly
It has been a long time since I came to Richang. The fruit is still very tasty & the ingredients are abundant. This is my first time to order BBQ pork buns. It is the Southern taste of soft flour that I love.

What is the way to drink red label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies, some like collecting, some people like food, and some like wine tasting. Red Brand Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in all countries, and it also won the gold prize at the international wine competition.
Every bottle of red label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you can spoil its flavor.
So how do I drink red label whisky?
Let me introduce it briefly to all of you.
Here's how to Drink Red Label Whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is made from around 35 types of Scotch whisky and has rich aroma and traditional Scotch whisky characteristics. The aroma is sweet and smoky.
The palate is rich and fresh with a slight hint of vanilla and strong smoky malt flavors.
This wine can be enjoyed directly on ice or mixed with any favourite beverage.
Red-brand whisky enters China. To adapt to Chinese people's tastes, red-brand whisky combined with soft drinks such as Coke or Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sourness, can bring visual pleasure to people, and when added to drinks, can dilute the alcohol flavor and change the taste.
Red brand whisky + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granular sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic Hongfangwei has a slightly sour taste. Adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will give the wine a refreshing flavor. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal tastes.
The above three are the best ways to drink red whisky. Everyone can try these out as a reference. I hope our introduction can help everyone.
Educational thinking: How university exams allow "scholars" and "scumbags" to each have their own place - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiao Tong University wrote letters to school leaders, expressing their confusion about college examinations, and raised demands to raise the exam difficulty and change the pattern of test questions to truly reflect the students' actual proficiency.
Indeed, college exams have long been a“hot topic”.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels, and learning levels are extremely variable.
It is inevitable that there will be differing feelings in the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are monotonous with a high repetition rate, or the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a different feeling.
Students who don't practice can pass the exam without focusing, but if they find other ways, they may be able to achieve more with less effort.
In this way, "students" can pass exams without any investment, and even score high; "students" never give up classes, keep good assignments, notes, and test scores.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University report that problems existing in University exams are not without reason, and it is believed that Lanzhou Jiaotong University is not alone in such a situation.
In this sense, I would like to give my compliments to these three students who wrote letters honestly.
In fact, people who have gone to university know that it’s not uncommon to rush to prepare for exams, think of all sorts of ways to “get” exam questions from teachers, try to limit the scope of exams, and get “key tuition” before exams.
In my view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, evaluating the pass of a university exam depends on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and scientific propositions based on them.
Entering into undergraduate stages, majors are beginning to be subdivided, and many major courses mainly focus on basic knowledge.
It is needless to say that whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject is what the university exam must examine.
Undergraduate knowledge is based on the basic theories and common sense of the subject. From the perspective of knowledge, there is not much space for change and is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "Basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learned now, and that is the key point."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged and it does not mean that the exam questions are of single type and repetitive.
In many universities, the examinations are usually composed of question groups. The exam papers are organized by senior teachers in the subject, and all teachers tasked with the subject work in the grading of examination papers. In this way, the duplication of test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, a set of exam questions that conform to the actual situation of teaching and learning should be drawn up, and the questions should be arranged in a normal distribution based on the overall situation of students’ learning and the necessity to comprehensively master the teaching situation, and comprehensively analyze the level of students’
Exams are the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plan for any kind of exam, and if things go on like this, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the letters of advice from students and has deployed rectification plans across the school.
Every teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and course-end self-examination, formulate examination papers and corresponding frameworks, strengthen the security of procurement and examination, and refine the assessment of achievement levels, and strengthen the overall evaluation of course teaching.
Mechanistically solving problems such as single type of test questions and duplication of questions is a topic that university examinations must face. Of course it is necessary to introduce appropriate systems, but it is expensive in daily life. Teachers must have overall understanding of the teaching situation. It is necessary to not only understand teaching contents, but also students' learning situation.
If changing the location of the branch for me is not possible, can I do delivery instead?

Mrs Jin Wedding Photography (South Street) has no branch for the time being
Because we had not arranged the time properly before taking the photo, the time was changed twice. Consultant Lanland patiently helped us arrange the time.
I chose to shoot the photo on a weekend with nice weather.
The staff of Mrs. Kim, whether they were consultants, makeup artists or photographers, were just amazing.
It was the first time in my life that I would formally wear makeup and wow~ I cant believe that someday I'll become so good looking lol
Xiaojie and the other girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient in applying makeup, and their makeup is also very natural.
The location was taken in Jiangwan City. Thankfully the weather was good that day and it was not too cold. When we took pictures, our makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and helmets from time to time.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I always feel very happy after taking pictures all day long.
When choosing photos, because a lot of cases on the internet were viewed, I was reluctant to let guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, I didn’t want to add any photo.
Today I finished editing the photos and Lanlan sent them to me. I found two pictures that were not very good and they immediately fixed those pictures for me.
After comparing the photos that my sister took in the past, I think I am actually very satisfied with our photos as they are simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take a wedding photo with Mrs Xuan Hanjin!
Price for this set is: 3,999yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful for you all and sincerely wishes you all a happy and prosperous future!
How much is this set?
What conditions must be met for that $32 to be available for use?
That's fine, no refund is required
Your rider said it can’t be found
Could not find
But I can’t understand the English he speaks

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah are without birth certificate because special anti-counterfeiting paper is out of stock
Kota Kinabalu: The Sabah National Registration Department said that, due to the shortage of special security papers, it was unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October and the number of affected people has reached 3200 people.
However, the director of the bureau, Kerou Aminus, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference in response to an online media report that the issue of printing birth certificates in Sabah had been a problem for 10 months.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak is also facing this same issue.
“One reason is that Chinese manufacturers that produced special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the virus, causing delay of their delivery to our country.”
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from other regions, so no goods can be borrowed from other states.
Cairou Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was subsequently handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to pick up the product in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and return to Sabah for immediate final printing. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicants in two more working days (December 20)."
“We will notify applicants to go to local branch offices to collect birth certificates.”
He added that Sabah had issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far in this year.
Ready from 7 am till now
Is that coming soon?
I mean food
I’m waiting opposite #PRS_ORG# again
OK, thanks, because the restaurant says it’s ready

These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and the fruitful efforts of the whole party and the Chinese people of all nationalities.
Practice once again proves that it has a decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country in the new era as well as for promoting the great historic process of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping at the steering wheel as the core of the CPC Central Committee and of the whole party, with the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and with the people of all ethnic groups across the country working hard together, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and create new epochs and great historical achievements in building a comprehensive modern socialist country.

To carry forward the spirit of building Party, adhere to the keynote of ensuring progress while maintaining stability

Education Info: Beijing reduces proportion of specialised students enrolled in junior high school in 2016 - Xinhua
The examination of special students who are enrolled in junior high schools in Beijing was organized and implemented by the education committees in all districts on September 21 and 22.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio for qualified students, and the competition for special education students has become more fierce.
For example, in Dongcheng District, the proportion of the students with abilities in primary school to middle school this year will generally not exceed 5% of the planned enrollment.
All students with talents in sports, art, and technology who registered online are eligible to participate in the admission test for qualified students.
To facilitate students to participate in the examination near by, Dongcheng District continued the examination arrangements from last year, with 1 or 2 examination locations set up in each school area, making 13 examination locations in total.

The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has issued a notice recently on strengthening the prevention and control of new coronary pneumonia in port cities, requiring that persons who have recently left land border port cities (except those with ports connected with Hong Kong and Macau) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who have traveled to land border port cities will undertake at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date each province, region and city determines and announces the city limits of ports, through to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that eligible port cities may examine the setting up of buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant official from the National Health Commission’s Disease Prevention and Control Agency said for some port cities, cross-border trade is the mainstay of the local economy, and people at the border from both sides communicate frequently.
Implementing regional differentiated management policies has changed from one line of defense against spillovers to two, and is expected to move the barrier forward, reduce the risk of outbreak spillover, and achieve the greatest results in epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impacts and low social costs.
There have been several clustered local outbreaks in China recently, all of which were imported from overseas via port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this has exposed issues such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning, lack of implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk positions, routine nucleic acid tests, inefficient sanitization of refrigeration sources and poor management of centralized isolation sites, and lack of scientific precision in emergency response to the outbreak.
The notification requires that efforts should be made in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms of port cities, improving epidemic monitoring and early warning systems, and implementing border control measures to expedite efforts to fill in weak spots in the prevention and control of port cities.
All port cities should synchronize epidemic prevention and control with precautionary measures, publicize and preserve hotlines for the protection of people's livelihood, and regularly investigate potential hidden dangers in the supply and prices of basic necessaries, so as to promptly resolve and proactively respond to serious problems raised by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities include the cities (regions, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities where the open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) according to epidemic prevention and control needs and promptly announced.

YouTube video shows the truth about the bloodthirsty killings of the US military in the past 20 years-Xinhua News Agency
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on YouTube generated widespread attention titled “Killing Machine.”
The film narrates that the US initiated the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war. For 20 years, the United States has resorted to violence, bloodlust, killing innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The use of drones to air raids on civilian sites such as hospitals and schools distorts human nature and promotes the establishment of killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" and imposed all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects."
Crimes against humanity fed more hatred among the Afghans
As stated in the video, the American-style “anti-terrorism” war becomes “more aggressive the more terrorists are being confronted.”
The war has not brought hope for peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only brought a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
So let us expose the truth about bloodthirsty massacres that take place in the United States in the name of "counter terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I stumbled upon the following article which discusses why this client wanted a logistics company in the bonded zone to do canned packaging from a commercial and shelf life perspective. Although canning belongs to deep processing and not within the scope of bonded logistics companies, the following article might explain why customers want to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and got in touch with a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for packaged milk powder and canned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference at all.
Then everyone must ask: Why is the shelf life of bags only one year and the shelf life of cans is two or more years?
Or ask: Why is there such a huge difference in price between cans and bags?
In fact, many consumers and mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different and therefore the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, except that everyone thinks the more expensive is the better.
There are consumers who reportedly said, after eating the canned food, that the taste or flavor of the canned product is different!
Now, let me first tell you the reason why listening equipment is expensive and what is the price?
Why is there such a large difference in the price of these same raw materials?
Most manufacturers considering when the package pricing is too high, consumers will be unable to accept it, which means that the profits made by manufacturers are very low or there is no profit, so how can manufacturers survive?
Therefore, they have had a large increase in the pricing of canned items to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers are recommending the packaging in cans, not bags.
And you would think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars each year in advertising, so where do these costs come from?
We can all imagine it.
Then, with the development of society, market promotion expenses, such as sales staff in shopping malls, exhibition fees at shopping malls, gift fees for products, advertising fees, etc., are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, manufacturers are continuously adding new products, and the prices of them are also rising continuously. In fact, these are new products that have been introduced as market costs increase.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits; in fact, the increase in the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands who, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulously linked them with the hospital doctors, who would assist in product promotion and receive a profit ranging from 30-80 yuan.
In China, such operations are absolutely forbidden by relevant laws. This method is actually causing harm to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy milk powder in bags and put them in the tin at home. This saves costs while improving the preservation and airtightness of the milk powder without affecting the children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned products is longer than that of bags. If the cans have the same shelf life as bags after they are opened, it’s just that the bags are not easy to store after opening and are prone to getting wet and deteriorating.

Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
Wherever you are in a book market, you can often feel the popularity of books about successful learning.
In today’s success books, many promote “best practices”—assuming or implying that you can “do it,” and then telling you what to do.
It means that we have completely skipped the most important and fundamental link in “how to do it”.
For this reason, these books have one thing in common -- either just do your best or do nothing; either 100 or 0; either you ascend mount or you stay put.
This "best principle" will be admitted by anyone who sees it as "extremely correct", but 99% of the people will be intimidated at the starting line.
This is because this theory advocates a path that says "you must make a decision to make a change in your life, start 180 degrees of transformation", which is a fatal weakness in many people.
For people who stick to conventions, adhere to old traditions and refuse change, you just shout in his ear "you need to change", which is undoubtedly a feat.
The vast majority of people appear timid in the face of the word "change" and hesitate to make a decision. Or, they make the decision to make "change" on a whim, and take the first step bravely.
Ma Sanli's famous cross talk in “Starting From Tomorrow” is a classic that most vividly expressed the “universal human nature.”
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, and therefore makes most people get appalled.
Perhaps the “second best principle” is one route that can potentially put more ordinary people on a path of relative success.
The main point of the “second best principle” is to lower the threshold—it encourages a theory of “small wins for bigger wins”, that is, if you can’t do 100, only achieve 1: because 1 is always greater than 0;
In all, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere. As long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the path to success following the "second best principle" is just slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle" on the surface is supposed to let everyone succeed, but it ultimately inspires only a few; and the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many people as possible.

reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
The new monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,100 tons (up to 108,500 tons) this year compared to the previous year, a 40-fold increase compared to the initial period of protection in 2002.
The common name of naked carp in Qinghai Lake is “Huang Yu”. It is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the ecological chain security and biodiversity of Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human intervention, as well as the deterioration of the breeding water environment for naked carp, the population of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Species in China" in 2004.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed lakes to breed fish and prohibited any units, groups and individuals from catching naked carps in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
Meanwhile, efforts to protect the water have been continuously strengthened by measures such as artificial enhancement and release, cleaning of the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake and designing scientifically reasonable fish passages, and the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Agriculture and Rural Department, indicated that up to now, nearly 180 million carp had been artificially proliferated and released, and had contributed over 23% to the recovery of the carp resources of Qinghai Lake.
The Three Rivers source region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area controlling the westward spreading desertification.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the headwaters of the three rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain biodiversity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued the prohibition on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake this year.

I just came across an article about menstrual holidays, but it's too long.
Let me give advice to people who do not know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual period some time between the ages of 13 and 15 and amenorrhea around age 50.
Afterwards, I will be doing this on a more regular basis once each month, provided my body is healthy.
However, it isn't regular enough to accurately predict. There is a tolerance of about a week or so and preparations need to be made in advance. Sometimes, it will overturn with bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The duration of time, blood volume, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week.
My menstrual cycle is uncontrollable and bleeding comes within 24 hours from beginning to end, and all I can do is use sanitary napkins or tampons to stop the blood from reaching clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately before the menstrual period begins may effectively alleviate the pain in that month, but taking it after the dysmenorrhea begins is useless.
During the menstrual period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If your cycle is about to arrive and you have diarrhea for no reason, you will typically menstruate within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise, they are likely to breed bacteria and eliminate sleep time. In a worst-case scenario, they may need to be replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which means 42 pieces. If you add the amount prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, rather than one piece every month.
(I make a modification here, the tampons don’t have to be changed often, about once every five or six hours, the longest is eight hours)
Hormones may wreak havoc during menstruation. During ovulation, the body is also unstable because of changes in hormones, which is very unfortunate and the body makes trouble for itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women still have a high ability to control their emotions, and they will not use emotional problems as excuses.
It wasn't just blood that was flowing and it included the shedding of the lining of the uterus.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the most thin, but gradually grew to be thicker after that. This can be viewed as a house.
Menstrual period is very inconvenient. For decades, bleeding is detected 24/7 on several days a month, as well as abdominal pain. Who would like that?
But people get born because their mothers have menstruation. And menstruation is to prepare you for living in this world for ten months when you first come to the world. Everyone should thank their mothers for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society thought that women were dirty and shameful. People thought that was so, but the times have changed.
If anyone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that women's body preparation practices that give birth to life are disgusting, and shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and stop thinking this way. Men who have never experienced it, won't experience it in their lifetime, and don't know much about it, shouldn't be so ungrateful. How can you be so embarrassed to face your mother and want your own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they’re really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice period, and it is disappointing to have the wrong item delivered
I need to order extra meals for the kids
I hope the stores are busy with checking the products produced in the meantime
Are the numbness of feet in the foot tub caused by a leakage of electricity?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in improving foot care and health. Today, the Gome editor will answer this question. I hope this will be helpful to friends.
With people's increasing health consciousness, foot tubs are becoming more and more popular among consumers. Also, a large number of products of various grades have come into the market, offering many choices for consumers.
Compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot tubs are selling well, but there is no industry standard for foot tubs, so they pose certain security risks.
“It is too dangerous to soak your feet in electrically charged water!”
Mr. Li told reporters that, recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father as a birthday present, but his feet felt numb when he soaked.
At first Mr. Li thought it was caused by vibration in the foot bath, but when the vibration function turned off, his father felt numbness in the soles of his feet.
When Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, it turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was charged with electricity.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was quite good. Although the foot tub had been returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
He found out the footbath that has been popular for a long time now has no clear and detailed industrial regulation in terms of the maximum temperature settings, what kind of people it is suitable for, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, there will be no electrification issues for foot bath tubs, but it is not ruled out that a few products are not strictly inspected when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot tub when purchasing.
The separation of water and electricity means there is no safety hazard.
You can test it using a pencil just at any time.
Fourteenth provincial tea expo opens
Hunan Daily, December 10th (English reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition will showcase the tea industry, innovate technologies, promote tea culture and accelerate the development of the 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Council, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Prof. Liu Zhonghua, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, brilliantly introduced at the opening ceremony that the source of Huhong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "Multicolor Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted efforts to set up the high-quality tea industry in Hunan and established the development pattern of “Sanxiang, four waters, and five-color tea”.
Major tea efforts such as green tea, dark tea and black tea have been ongoing, and key tea-producing regions have also promoted the integration of tea and tourism that has led to higher incomes for the tea growers.
Feng Shui changes in turn, and the black tea exerts its strength again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers are able to earn income all year round, and the production value of tea plantations has soared.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded a license for the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the trademark of "Hunan black tea".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants spotted a alpine tea called “Bing Lichun”, and placed orders immediately.
The secretary of the provincial tea industry association, Wang Zhun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market more or less, but there were many bright spots at the Expo 2019.
The Xinhua Black Tea with a touch of red, has a strong tea culture connotation. Its popularity and business are flourishing, and Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.

Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, via rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics are basic principles of philosophy that aim to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name ”metaphysics” is taken from the word “Metaphysical is called Way, what is beneath form is called implement”, which was translated by Japanese Tejiro Inoue (Meiji Era) by metaphysic.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
Ontology is “the study on which nouns represent real entities while which nouns simply represent a concept”.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
It is theoretically based on the concept that all phenomena can be explained by natural causes, put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to a method for research that makes no mention of God.
Philosophy of the Mind is the branch of philosophy that investigates the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two major schools of thought in discussing the "relationship between mind and body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and extent of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study about the moral life of humans; here, morality is defined as all norms of conduct agreed upon by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (which abstractly studies the nature of ethical theories or criticism), normative ethics (which estimates diverse moral values and proposes moral codes for right and wrong conduct).
It studies what patterns of moral conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the science of applying ethical theory to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live, and summarizing observed patterns.
It examines ethics not from preconceived theories but looks at actual decisions made and observed by an actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to that choice, and discusses ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: humanistic ethics, represented by those including Valera and Montaigne.
Part II: The ethical thinking of the Reformation, as represented by Calvin.
The third part: Political ethics
Logic is a discipline that studies "principles and standards for valid inference and justification."
Logic generally includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, and can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a science that’s the subject of research into the nature and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the 30 years after our relatives were killed, especially the unstoppable assistance since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends home and abroad, in early 1994.
Now most of the victims' parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started their own families and have jobs.
It was your acts of kindness that have helped us through the most difficult times for those struggling families.
The coronavirus pandemic is currently raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop offering donations to our troubled family — the Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian aid campaign should have seen its perfect ending.
I will always remember your love and I firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, and I ask for your understanding!
Please accept my sincere blessings
Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance being done by IFCSS and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
The IFAD and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations in engaging in humanitarian aid, and executors of the projects often overlap.
(Picture from Apple Daily: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Oftentimes, relief funds cannot be delivered to families of victims of the June 4th Incident.
In 1994, upon the suggestion by Ms. Ding, “Tiananmen Mothers” set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphan Education Fund which was implemented 11 years later. In 2009, after all June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF set up the June 4th Aided Senior Orphans Assistance Fund, and it has been running since.
Funding for these projects is primarily from the campus and community donations made on June 4, the generous donations of individuals, and supports from the Fraternal Universities Foundation for Democracy.
It has also received the support of the Laogai Research Foundation since 2018.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the family members of the victims of the June Fourth finally received a part of donations from Hong Kong raised in the name of June Fourth.
During this time, the Human Rights Society of China has been independently implementing their humanitarian assistance program.
We understand that Mr. Ding's decision to stop donation was for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed some retirees whose income is not as plentiful as before retirement. We would like to express our appreciation to Mr. Ding for his letter "To a Friend".
We will respect the decision made by our families to terminate this program within two years and resume as soon as the need arises.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those who are generous and have been taking risks to deliver humanitarian donations throughout the years.

Thank you Rabbit for the comments, I originally said that rejection of classical art is not suitable for ancient contexts, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dandan for your approval, your satisfaction can enable us to move forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photo studio is really awesome and I highly recommend it to everyone!
Everything from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production was impeccable.
The makeup artists are particularly delicate and will match up their makeup according to your style, and all of the cosmetics used are top-ranking brands.
Tian Liang, needless to mention, is quite professional in photography.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two kitties playing with each other.
We are working in Beijing, and best photo studios in Beijing must line up six months in advance. My colleagues had shot in Beijing, and after viewing the completed film I thought it was just so so.
I have specifically looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, so I think this is the short version for most people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, an excellent team
When it came out, we and people around us all praised it appreciatively.
I've already recommended it to my girlfriend, and her best friend was equally happy about it after seeing the film.
I hope that such studios will not be buried. More people will find and photograph them in their own style instead of standardizing them.
I am very grateful to Ying Zhan and Jing Ling for their five-star reviews. Both are very innovative and creative newcomers. We are creative studios. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to accomplish it. Thank you for knowing each other.
Sweet and considerate assistants and lively and cheerful photographer teachers are super nice to everyone in the team! It is a wonderful and unforgettable experience and the result is much better than I expected. Thank you all for the hard work. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiao Yu for your comments. It is a fate to have met you. I am very happy to meet all of you and come to Qinhuangdao next time.

A programmer who is interested in sharing his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you have no idea in this area, it is best to study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot and takes 6 months.
But if you plan on getting in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those people who have very weak self-control.
If you have relatively strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
If the teaching staff are not strong enough, this training establishment is meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong staff.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to explore the students coming from this institution. After all, only the students of an institution know what is going on, and whether the courses presented are good or not.
Hi, I don’t know how to answer your question, because I haven’t done any introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your own circumstances.
Things such as majors, age, language you want to learn, or even in which city you are, will all be related to the industry you want to study or you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or have already graduated from the computer major, I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective training facility.
However, in these circumstances, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the Internet are free now, or there are many training resources on B station. If you are unable to find resources, you can also contact me through the profile for free resources or detailed consultations!
In addition, there are some relatively classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but also can pay a certain amount of money and time to study, then I suggest you study at a training institution, so that learning is not too much effort, the teacher can explain it in details, and someone will specifically answer any questions.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, and they provide options to recommend transfer to companies after training, so that the interview process for job hunting can save a lot of time.
What I have said above include my thoughts and descriptions as I do not know your personal situation and I will not explain in detail. If you have any other questions, you can always contact me to communicate.
I said I will be there by 1pm and I have seen it all in the app
what is it
I haven’t finished yet, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, cooking hoods, lamps, cleaning, professional beauty and housekeeping services.
Thanks for those who have given me praise silently, I work hard for my life, life is very tiring but we must continue
Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, please follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me praise
Life is like this, others only look at the result and stand alone in the process. Facing life, we have no choice but to continue, to be strong. We can look back but not go back.”
Cleaning is both a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although we do the dirtiest job in cleaning, we will clean every corner of the customer’s home with the most serious attitude. Seeing satisfied smiles and thumbs up from customers, all the hard work will be worthwhile at that moment, and the efforts will ultimately pay off!
my daily job

Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they can become dull even if they are not cleaned for a long time. They can shine only after cleaning. The same is true in life.
Success can only be achieved by working hard. We use meticulousness to create sophisticated designs. We are serious about the beauty of seam.
You can be satisfied if you give me the chance. Quality means everything, because my profession is worthy of trust, and your approval is my biggest encouragement!
Things are not working well in all industries today!
But I have always believed that as long as I am earnest, persistent and hardworking, I will be better than others, or at least it is better than sitting around and complaining.”
The plan of a day starts in the morning, and all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start your new day with happiness, luck, health, and self-fulfillment. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and I was happy if I had it; when I grew up, happiness was a goal advocated for fulfillment; when I was mature, I found that happiness is a state of mind, and I was feeling happy when I understood it.
Be the most genuine and kind self, live with our heart, without regrets in your life; we must take our own way in life; there are two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and a beautiful life!
Different challenges arise in every stage of life.
In many cases it is not your ability that restrains you, but your courage to face it in a positive way.
Since there is no way to avoid this, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you are overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face up to them, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to host Saudi Arabia's First Biennale of Contemporary Art-Xinhua News Agency
Diriyah Biennale Festival, the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, was officially opened to the public on December 11 at Diriyah JAX Art Zone in northwestern Saudi capital, Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating.
This biennale is co-curated by Saudi Diriya Biennale Foundation and China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Feiyu, curator of China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, as the artistic director.
It is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social economic transformation, and it also reflects the current condition of Saudi Arabia’s social and cultural development.
The exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters. Spread across six interconnected buildings, the exhibition will be presented in six units: Cross the River by Feeling the Stones, Heritage as Experiment, Thinking on a Edge, Going Public, Brave New World, and The Spirit of Art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists take up over 40% of the total exhibition, including painting, installation art and performance art. Other works from 12 Chinese artists have drawn recent attention. Some artists use recycled materials to create creative projects. For instance, Xu Bing uses waste to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Barclay, CEO of Dubai Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this year’s biennale will establish international dialogue, so that global audiences can have the opportunity to learn about the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and enhance interactions.
Feiyu Tian said, “The objective of the Biennale is twofold – to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogues, and to enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world.”
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize management of public welfare posts in rural areas - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide job support for people out of poverty and consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced relevant policies to improve rural revitalization and rural public welfare.
According to the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Services Department, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs to accommodate employees of poverty-stricken laborers and other rural groups of need.
The new regulations were jointly issued by Yunnan Human Resources, rural vitalization, and finance departments to uniformly regulate the targets, fund management, position development and job management of rural public welfare employees at the grassroots level.
In terms of post development settings, the new regulations are made clearly in accordance with the principles of "set posts on demand, assign employees based on posts, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who takes responsibility", and "one person per post, voluntary disclosure, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-job training and job placement.
Furthermore, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development institutions for rural public welfare jobs, the subsidies and payment methods for rural public welfare posts, and require all rural welfare job development departments to purchase commercial accident insurance for rural public welfare post-placement personnel. The relevant departments are required to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

Second, although the right wing had an era of success going on in history, it was of a short duration. Short because if you gave it just a bit of sunlight, it would brighten, and when you drink boiling water, you would perspire.
But in all truth, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy and improving technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not quite agree with Li Weidong’s remarks, I care about what he means and respect him very much; because he is serious about China, and he takes China’s social issues seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-revolutionary revolution will inevitably lead to social instability, damage to people’s livelihood, mixed political societies and foreign countries will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and people. Those who attempt to gain opportunities through political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Lets talk about the left again.
The Left is, in fact, a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right has positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to their remarks and analyze their thoughts when needed, the Left will not have such a fortune because what the Left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
5. I recently saw some friends being genuinely angry while confronting the illegitimate thief, I don’有人 think it’s unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors or the left-handed defectors, they are all silly and unreasonable.
It isn’t necessary to try to prove that we are right, let alone allow the rebels and left-handed bullies to admit it. Why are they here?
Let me tell my friends this: When a rebel scolds you for five cents and when the creeps call you a bull, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but when they get older, they forget their ideals, or pursue them but become paranoid.
The slayers get farther and farther away from this ideal, and even the hero who kills a dragon eventually turns into an evil dragon.
I feel left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China is a largely left-leaning nation due to the innate genes from its history and culture.
While domestic right-wingers advise on freedom and focus on efficiency and development, the leftists reinforce regulation and place a higher importance on fairness and security.
The society now generally wishes to put more emphasis on fairness. At the same time, the conflict in the US and China's left-wing is certain. It's estimated to continue for many years.
Even though I can't understand it, just comment and it's done
No need to say anything, Huahua is so unselfish
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists have not only put Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to US-based enterprises.
The US oppresses China's chip industry and requires its own companies and related companies in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing chip manufacturers to reduce research and development investment, and production capacity. This has resulted in global shortage of chip supply chains.
Presently, “chips shortage” has spread to major industries in the world. For example, automakers have closed production and cell phone prices have increased. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", technology giants in more and more countries have begun to move toward "de-beautification".
To maintain the global semiconductor power and hold back the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has made frequent actions recently, hosting a “chip summit”. It has invited 64 giants to set up semiconductor alliances, and funded support for American technology giants. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip sector, the old technology giant Intel has invested 20 billion U.S. dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and open up the chip foundry business.
Most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely that it will take away TSMC's "job".
This is because Intel, as an existing technology giant in the US, has been involved in the semiconductor field for decades and possesses a large talent team and technical reserves. It will definitely rise up quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive of Intel’s decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising speech. Regarding Intel's move to invest in building a foundry, Zhang Zhongmou spoke bluntly: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel’s entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still bears a grudge that has existed between TSMC and Intel over the past 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had always been the jewel of the US Empire’s manufacturing industry, held the top position in the world, and was the hegemon in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been dominated by a few powerful players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model in which chip design, manufacturing, packaging and testing were done by one factory. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small firms overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs cannot cope with enormous cost of building production lines.
Inspired by market demand, a phenomenon of division of labor began to appear in the chip industry after the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was specialized design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC has focused its main business on the single aspect of "wafer processing". It does not design anything, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, a company that had just been founded at the time, was a minion in the face of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only doing manufacturing in the chip industry, it obviously looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel had looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I did not expect that giants that looked down on wafer fabrication services in the past would now also start wafer foundries.
As such, Zhang Zhongmou felt it was ironic for Intel to enter the foundry.
TSMC’s market capitalization has now surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with an aggressive attack from TSMC, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.

Let's look at some of the [strangely popular searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of Eryon in February, Orion’s price increase, and the goods pulling event. Public opinion spreads to form a peak, and then the “exponential decrease” (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion arises, a small hump will appear again.
They look the same as the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
What is abnormal public opinion?
6 hot search items in the same event were randomly selected, displaying [simple peak shape], [jagged shape], [cliff shape].
[Solid Peak] means artificially heating its list to quickly improve the search and attract public attention; [Jawtooth] means periodical heating to ensure that a topic takes the top spot on the search list; [Cliff] means瞰 collectively, the search has finished its “function”, and then it receives new tasks, and rushes to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the crest of one event's popularity happens to be the trough of another event with exactly the same time. Then a unified batch of naval forces must have received a mission to start a new offensive.
One can see the professionalization of black public relations: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which are attracting attention, which are responsible for science popularization, which promote competition, which divert attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgments, which generates sentiments, which coerce decision-making. The hacker accounts are segmented and refined operations at different nodes, almost considering all factors in the spread of public sentiment.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors of opinion and sentiment, and considering objective data alone, there will be nowhere to hide in public public relations.
Anything we walk through will leave traces. We can dig out such traces together.

First cases of Omicron strain infection were found in Mauritius and other countries-Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12. According to reports from foreign reporters of Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new coronavirus-mutant Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported the first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain in the country on March 10.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; another infected person was a native Mauritian resident who tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contacting a person who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated in the hospital for treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people became negative and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced the first 3 cases of Myronium-derived infection in the country on June 10.
All three people were students. They returned from overseas traveling earlier this month. They were all with mild symptoms and were not admitted to hospital.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron virus strains, the Serbian government has continuously intensified prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 of next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by air will need to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arrival.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin administering Pfizer's novel coronavirus vaccine among the country's children aged 5 to 11.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on Thursday the country had identified three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The three cases of infection were identified by genetic sequencing of 12 coronavirus-positive samples collected by the country’s health authorities from November 9 to December 2.

At first it was recommended by a friend because of trust, so I chose to have a look at it. At first my budget was 70,000 for a basic decoration.
As soon as I arrived in the store, a series of scams started.
It was the first time I came to the shop and just showed them my house layout chart. They didn't visit my home. But they were able to quote me the price of a house worth $70,000. They showed me their materials and didn't know what their brands are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you get there they will drag you over to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay a deposit, they invited their so called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than ten thousand.
The quote he gave me had many problems. The $70k didn’t include electrical renovations, any doors, cabinets and bathrooms. Those three were the bulk of the installing cost.
In addition to these, their point of service charges are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and they made me sign the contract without clarifying anything at first.
When I went to them to refund money they seemed very experienced and there was a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
Either way it's the client's problem, and they have absolutely no fault for it.
There are various shirks of responsibility and many details. I am crying if I don't want to say them all. In short, do not choose them, because the quality of the houses my friends have renovated with them is also poor. I will pay you for all kinds of expenses later.
Crap, they were deceptive faucets and now they’ve been replaced by Damei, which seems to have retreated and become something else.
So do not choose such an unprofessional decoration company.
In the future, everyone can look upon these websites more on Baidu when they are making decisions as the decoration is not expensive.
If you want to ask the merchant a question, please login or register first
Posting any form of merchant reviews is strictly prohibited, please refer to the merchant acceptance statement for details
Dianping Kunming decoration design channel will provide you with the latest information of merchants such as Damei 360 integrated home improvement address, telephone number and opening hours. When searching for decoration companies, investors can go to Dianping.
So horrible, please cancel your order if it does not come within 30 minutes!
isn't there any other way? for example, change address
OK, then please don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get a refund within 5-10 days, I'll be held accountable.
I asked if I could cancel in less than 15 minutes
The chicken should be cooked, but the meat I received is raw and can't be eaten
A new encounter in the sky: Gemini meteor shower will appear massive on April 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy and popular science experts explained that as the last large meteor shower this year, the Geminids meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will be its biggest on December 14. Those who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night.
Beijing-based astronomy enthusiast Anjiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent objects of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not "born" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, council member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and astronomy popularization expert, said that like the New Year feature film, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "release period" can run from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and together with the Quadrantid and Perseid meteor showers, it is known as the third major meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere.
A significant feature of the Geminid meteor shower is its relatively slow speed, rich colors and numerous fireballs, which is suitable both for visual observation and for beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year’s Gemini meteor shower will reach its maximum around 15:00 on December 14. The maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors visible per hour when the radiant is directly overhead) is 150.
Chart of recommended index numbers for Geminid meteor shower.
“Last year, the Geminid meteor shower was impressive, but this year’s Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, making it less exciting.
November 14 falls on the 11th day of the lunar calendar. The moon is a crescent moon. The bright moonlight may disturb the observation. Fortunately, after the midnight, the moon will set, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will shine relatively higher.
Those who like meteor showers can observe them in these hours after the moon falls in the latter half of the night, but they should pay attention to keeping warm and cold."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended for observations in urban areas, but in the suburbs or rural areas, you can choose aplace with high altitude, low light pollution, and a bright view facing the northeast, then wait until the moon has set and then visually observe.
It should be noted that the flow of Geminid meteors in all directions is very large, so there is no need to always stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
For photographers who want to take wonderful pictures of a meteor shower, they'd better select a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, backup batteries and a cable switch are also essential.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TVs and traditional TVs in terms of market positioning?
In my opinion, the traditional TV the topic refers to is LCD TV, and the difference in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly comes from the following two points:
First, laser TVs are focused more on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are clearly more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products made for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly from 55 to 65 inches, while those of laser TVs are generally over 75 inches and the largest is over 100 inches, fully satisfying users’ needs for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, global shipments and sales volume of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for over 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMC's forecast, sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why laser TV has such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to its outstanding performance in eye protection.
Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions and causes less irritation to the eyes.
Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Institute and an eye expert from Beijing Union medical institution have obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparative experiment in which people watched laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions.
It has been confirmed by the data that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection properties, and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when eye health has received more and more importance, laser TVs not only attract more and more users by its advantages of eye protection, but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline of prices for LCD TVs, prizes of most laser TVs currently on the market exceed 10,000 yuan and are gradually rising as size and light sources are upgraded.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV or projection.
With the use of ultra-short focus projection technology, laser TVs achieve a shorter projection distance compared with traditional projection devices, and allow for the ability to experience a large 100-inch screen within a short distance.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it generates less heat, less wear to the equipment, and the lifespan of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as equivalent 4K UHD image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring more impressive visual experience to users.
It’s not pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. For picture quality and input-output ratio, Laser TV is not just for audiovisual players.
Simply put, ultra wide-angle near-focus projectors, laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which are not in line with optics’ optimal design.
Using a microstructured Fresnel curtain in order to shield part of the ambient light is expensive, and a 80-inch LCD can be basically replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Another point is that I particularly hate the idea of the diffuse reflection being nice to the eyes, because it is a selling point for projector manufacturers. Please, what the eyes can see on the screen is the direct light.
Moreover, if the projection screen were not diffusely reflected, there would be no image at all.
The hot spot effect of high gain screen is just ignored, it is really uncomfortable when a lot of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio has no branch for the time being
After adding the appointment date on WeChat, the lady sent me the timetable I could choose and my reply is relatively timely~
Before I went there, I had seen the shoots on camera. It mostly involved outdoor wedding dresses. The shoot is very beautiful and involves many shooting styles.
When the day arrived, I briefly shared my ideas with my sister. I patiently tried on two sets of styles I had trouble with, and finally finished makeup and styling ~ The photographer will set up some props and guide the movements before filming, while keeping the details to perfection.
But perhaps because I didn't share specific shooting ideas with me, the style I created was not what I wanted, but it should be pretty lovely🙊🙊
After the shooting is done, the photographer will help choose the photos and exchange post-processing styles, so I felt very careful.
It will take about half a month to repair the piece, so wait for the effect~
This is the second time I won the photo event. I can choose one piece for most of the clothes in the audience.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, and the photographer in charge is the brother of the post-95s generation. I feel a little bit young. I hope to give more suggestions in the future for customer shooting instructions. It is chatty and the shooting process is pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio prefers quality shops
On the home page, let me also take a look at Queenie~
After arriving, fill in the name number and phone number, then select the clothes. All wedding dresses are acceptable and I have been patient with changing three or four outfits. After choosing, I use make-up for a long time. After the photoshoot, the service attitude is also very good.
[Environment] The overall situation is fine.
Lots of clothes to choose from.
There were roughly three makeup locations, and there was a photo studio inside.
【Service】Very friendly and attentive
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the moves very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will offer to take alternate shots.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit unusual. The original double eyelids was pasted with triple eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who do not draw eyebrows on a regular basis.
I have taken photos with them for ten days, but the image effect of P is not satisfactory. It seems that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I didn't quite know what style to use, I tried two sets and ultimately I picked a black dress. My sister said that this set was more Hepburn retro.
After choosing the clothes I started doing makeup and hair. The hair stylist and makeup artist were super patient to help me get it done. I am very satisfied with the results!
After finishing makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer gave me instructions to pose during the entire process, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After I finished shooting, I carefully selected four top photos as my favorite ones. Brother said that the movies will be finished in 15 minutes and I'm very satisfied with the ending~
I haven't received a reply in 3 days...I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan because your system cannot recognize my credit card!
The weirdest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make payments
I have to pay for shipping every time now
Can I waive the exemption and charge my monthly fee after the investigation is completed, is that OK?
Is it safe to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Umbrella is an Internet based insurance brokerage platform.
A few key terms: The shareholder and the promoter must have no major law violation records in the last 3 years. The minimum amount required to establish the security brokerage institution is RMB 50 million. It needs the permission of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three terms are actually very strict, and they are indeed strong. They must be authorized by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (the nation’s domestic authority over private insurance), and shareholders must have good conduct. As a small umbrella insurance brokerage company, investors should not question whether the small umbrella insurance is验证 or not. After all, no insurance company can meet these three restrictions.
At this point, there is no problem. It is trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products, Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many celebrities critical illness guidelines are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critical Illness Insurance.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet-based products have high cost performance, support fees for monthly payment, reduce payment pressures on policyholders, and maximize insurance leverage.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of clerk professionalism: this is particularly important because insurance is an extremely demanding industry, and many Internet product customers can either apply for insurance on their own. As such, there are numerous misunderstandings such as health notification and occupation;
I myself have done insurance telesales on "Tencent We-Insurance" (like Umbrella, also a platform for Internet insurance brokers), so I am very responsible to share this with others.
Internet insurance is real, and reliable, but people cannot be trusted. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels and there are many misleading salespeople.
For example: 1 yuan of 6 million Insurance plans, buy insurance to get mobile authorization, receive 60,000 critical illness coverage for free, these marketing strategies are correct, but they ignore the major ones. They won't tell the insured that they require one yuan per month to pay the normal amount.
I thought we could spend 1 dollar and the insurer will pay 6 million (the world has fallen out of pie).
Free mobile phone delivery, sent only to special policy numbers such as 6666, 8888. The winning SMS will not be exchanged, nor will anyone remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured.) The free 60,000 critical illness coverage is short term, and if this is the only insurance policy, there is no commercial insurance to cover it. In the event of serious illness, what can I do? It can't solve the problem and my future life will start playing around.
At present, the state is also severely cracking down on misleading insurance sales on the Internet.
So on a whole, there is no problem with the platform or product. What is problematic is the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople.
In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokerage companies are broader, and customers have many opportunities and products to choose from. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I've personally helped 59 Internet customers in underwriting offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan per year in insurance premium per person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to connect and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance brokers, have three years experience in corporate management training, served nearly a thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will customize insurance products for clients based on customer’s needs.
We grow together with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to everyone!
According to the definition by insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is insurance in which an applicant can complete all insurance application processes independently after clicking on the insurance application link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant. All steps can be completed by the insured by themselves.
Although online insurance purchase is not too "ceremonial", and may even not contain a printed paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract in any way.
This model is similar to “telephone sales” outside the ordinary pipeline, but there is a fatal problem when purchasing insurance this way, which is that subsequent services might not keep pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When purchasing insurance, we should carefully consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is a long-term companion for us and will provide services to us in many years.

From before to now, I have always opposed slander and abuse in any form, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such villains.
If one does not look at political parties and factions, the first thing that must be resisted is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From your Facebook friending request followed by snarky posts, to your attempt to reveal my home place and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only keep tagging me on the basis of the frequency of 6 meals per day, but also continued to discuss some low-key and humiliating remarks about me
I know that afterwards I received emails from a number of friends about uploading a photo on your Facebook friend account and sexually harassing remarks.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I just can't be silent any longer.
After the news of my police report was uploaded, you did not restrain yourselves at all. Instead, you became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you have. In our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can keep making those bombastic, veiled, humiliating, abusive things. You can keep saying you just care and follow me. You can keep calling it harassment. You can even deny it wasn't your image and keep making all kinds of offensive statements.
Yes, I cannot, and I have no power to, stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to meet you, nor do I need your judgment about my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl who would be willing to shame others in the exchange for fame.
My friend asked me if I was doing okay?
I said it and you won't believe me.
I don't think there's any girl that can still say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics, or the business world, only those who have no basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that fairness is at the heart of it all.
I cut a part of the message out for everyone to comment on
There should be no one else who can impersonate you in your own postings
all I can say is that you are the enemy of civilization
I smiled knowingly

Home appliances here are relatively complete and there are many brands, including all well-known brands.
On the occasion of October 22, I went to the "Hanston" water purifier store to check the water purifier. There is a lot of activity in the store, and the prices are relatively favorable.
There are 11 floors in the house, and the second floor to the 9th floor are the parking lots, and the parking is free in the daytime!
The surroundings are not very good, there are few hardware stores here, and the restaurants taste average.

Mainstream of Yangtze River achieves full coverage of comprehensive water green service areas---Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, Dec. 11. (Reporter Wang Xian) The Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Chongqing City was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th.
So far, the comprehensive green water service area has covered upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration of the Ministry of Transport, has said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 green integrated water service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were recognized by the majority of seafarers and played a significant role in advancing the high-quality development of shipping in the Yangtze River.
The full coverage of green integrated service areas on the water is another milestone in green shipping development in the Yangtze River. The capability of receiving and shipping pollution from vessels in the Yangtze River has been significantly enhanced.
According to reports, the Green Water Integrated Service Area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for ships and crew members, and for helping the crew solve the problem of "urgent hardship and frustration".
The two integrated green service zones on water on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River which are under operation this time combine living services, production services and government affairs services, and take green environmental protection as the theme and feature the ship maintenance and emergency rescue services.
These three U.S. aircraft carriers, equipped to accumulate the most powerful weapons near China, make a rare visit to Guam
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", the USS Carl Vinson was discovered by a satellite near the Barabac Strait on January 9.
Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategically important location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that "Carl Vinson will be deployed in the South China Sea."
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Osprey carrier aircraft on board.
One of the US military aircraft carriers currently cruising in the Pacific, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which will depart the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also was the first carrier to carry a fleet of F-35C aircraft belonging to the 314th Fighter Strike Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Aside from the above two carriers, the current US Navy deployment in the Asia-Pacific region also includes the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform” released the latest satellite photos showing that three US aircraft carriers were assembling near China.
(Weibo@South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) Three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China to make a rare visit to Guam January 17, 2022, the flight path of a US carrier-based transport plane CMV-22B.
According to a report from CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam this past weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base on Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers made their rare visit to Guam with the most powerful weapons around China, which analysts said was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and just the second public visit to it since the 1980s.
In recent years, the United States has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands.
The picture shows Yongshu Island in China's Nansha Islands.
The visit to Guam intensifies cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region and demonstrates US capability, flexibility, readiness and continuing commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific, the Navy said in a statement.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder" submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are typically kept strictly secret.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines made the vessel “the most critical survival weapon in the nuclear triad,” which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located across the U.S. and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting with friends about the recent 26% plunge in Meta, a market valuation likely to fall by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he "faced unprecedented competition". What's the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is actually an advertising company, and it generates its income mainly from advertisements. Nowadays, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what functional positioning it is, are all traffic channels for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertising network”, and many apps are connected with Meta advertisements and realizing earnings through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to adjustments of Apple’s privacy policies, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain information about users, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apples current privacy policies are very user-friendly and will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to access their own information. The normal response of most people is definitely to not allow it.
Next, if Google revs up again, the impact on Meta’s revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10 percent of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by companies in China doing overseas business.
Meta has roughly a few hundred people in its offices in Hong Kong and several major agencies in the mainland.
Meta is an inescapable advertising channel for Chinese companies that want to expand to overseas markets, and most of the money they burn goes to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte-based TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise on Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I have not been specifically looking into this recently, but it’s definitely not going to be any better than before.
The phase in which Chinese companies were burning cash overseas on a massive scale has ended.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms, including TT, are not in Meta’s hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only cares about income, more importantly it looks at what the future is expected to look like.
It is clear that Meta's expectations were insufficient.
In an attempt to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse."
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions in the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta within these two years.
So in the next two years, it should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Despite its popularity, Facebook has revenue of US$100 billion to 200 billion a year, but Facebook has a huge sense of crisis now. Compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no safe moat.
Although several of his social apps have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook still lacks confidence in the face of the rapid development of Tiktok. Any subversion is a blink of an eye.
The limitless concept of the metaverse has no hopes of success in the short term and therefore Facebook is very dangerous. That is the reason why Zuckerberg has changed his company's name and is constantly searching for new tracks. However, I think his single choice of track is wrong and it is a road of no return. Above are my thoughts for reference.

Joint military exercise of "Peace Relief - 2021" between Chinese and Vietnamese army is completed successfully
Hanoi, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- All Chinese participating teams from the "Peace Rescue-2021" joint military exercise between China and Vietnam have returned to Guangxi, China on the morning of the 12th, marking the successful completion of the seven-day training mission.
In this joint exercise, focusing on the major topic of humanitarian medical rescue, the two armies closely followed medical mission to save lives and heal the wounded and completed subjects such as joint medical command, joint on-site rescue and mass casualty treatment in accordance with practical standards. These subjects had significantly improved the medical support capabilities of both militaries.
The results of the exercise were affirmed by the armed forces of both China and Vietnam.
Vietnamese military doctors are learning experiences from Chinese military doctors, but also have the knowledge of China’s medical and security equipment.
The results achieved in the exercise have proved the professional capabilities of the military medical forces of the two countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
Chen Chunming, the leader of the Chinese Guidance and Coordination Team and deputy director of the Central Military Commission, said in a statement that the exercise was another pioneering and innovative practice based on the successful joint free consultation activity in 2018, and was a very significant milestone.
During the exercise, the PLA donated health and epidemic prevention materials such as medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid detection equipment to the Vietnamese People's Army.
