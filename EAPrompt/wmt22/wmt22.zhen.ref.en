Is there a way to punish him?
So that such a thing won’t happen again.
And how much longer does it take for the restaurant to prepare it? Could could help me ask them?
Students played the leading role at the Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University with creative research achievements - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, diagnosing disease through breath, and accurately seeking for source of smog; last night, a series of creative academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, with research covering major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education; students created many high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: your home physical examination doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone with the size of only a half of a smart phone.
“All you need to do is to breathe out, and this set of instrument can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the components of the air you breathe out.”
Zhang Diming introduced, this set of sensor is connected to the smart phone; after you breathe out, the health report will be shown on your phone.
Smart bands on the market which can detect health conditions often measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensor uses the new material of graphene; its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell” enables it to reflect the health status of the body more in-depth and accurately.
Smart operation lamp: high-functioning eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart operation lamps are now being used in operating rooms.
This invention has won the silver prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two graduate students from School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, developed a new idea trying to solve the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the smart LED operation shadow-less lamp.
“Improper early detection of many diseases and inaccurate excision are related to operation lamps used by doctors.”
According to Shen Junfei, for example, in early inspection of cancer, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, the tumor cells will still spread.
This type of smart operation lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformness and shadow-less degree any time according to demands of operation and personal habits.
This type of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Shaw Hospital Afflicted to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and received favorable feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup Competition.
Washing hands with air: save water in a cool way
Normally, people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap and sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of “equipment to wash hands with air”.
As long as we stand on the washbasin of the equipment, our weight can compress the air out.
“Just like an inflator.
The air compressed out can form a flow at the faucet and combine with water.
As such, we can wash our hands clean!”
Chromogenic reaction and germ residue experiment results prove that the effect of hand washing this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.
This equipment is only driven by our weight, which can not only guarantee we wash our hands clean, but also save 90% of water; the entire process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environment-friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention emerged among all the top universities in the world and was awarded with the only gold award.

If so, please place an order soon.
We don’t have it at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#.
I am done waiting, and I’ll cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I left the wrong address.
Can I change it?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, sorry for the inconvenience.
A certificate I deem meaningful, Certificate of First Aid
I think this is one of the most important skill type certificate except for driving license!
For your information: first aid measures refer to emergency rescue in emergencies, i.e., emergency treatment conducted before the coming of the ambulance.
As everyone knows, there is a period before the coming of the ambulance after the accident happens, which is most critical.
This period is the most important time for first aid.
If we suffer from heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage or respiratory arrest, our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is very important for those around us to know first aid!
When somebody falls down, we can conduct first aid with our professional knowledge, instead of doing nothing and only standing there; this helpless feeling is really frightening.
“In China, 3 million people die from accidents every year according to official data, and the most dangerous one is known as cardiac arrest.
15% of people of cardiac arrest can be brought back to life in the United States.
In the Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, 70% or 80% of them can be brought back to life, and the proportion in Shanghai and Beijing is lower than 1%. ”
Said Lu Le, the founder of the First Reaction.
Pinching philtrum has no effect at all if a person suffers from cardiac arrest and there is no sign of breathing or heartbeat.
Artificial respiration and external chest compression are required to bring them back to life.
I found that very few people have the awareness to study first aid knowledge, but it will be too late once accident happens; therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond timely when faced with emergency situations.
We may bring somebody back to life with this skill!
People can apply for the certificate of first aid at your local Red Cross Training Center, and I applied for my certificate at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai; students are offered with a discount.
PS: The last picture is the goals I aim to achieve before 25 years old; I added the Certificate of First Aid a couple months ago, but I did achieve it!
Next, I will apply for other certificates; I plan to get Diving Certificate; I saw on Red earlier that there is a Diving First Aid Certificate, which requires a Certificate of First Aid first, so getting a Certificate of First Aid is useful!
I ordered ＃#NUMBER#.
There is only one 13-yuan shrimp dumpling! ?
I haven’t tried it before.
How can you not write your #NAME# clearly?
Is it 13 yuan for only one?
Yesterday  #PRS_ORG# missed some food in the delivery, and now I only have one shrimp dumping! ?
Because I clearly saw the code was valid when I entered it.
I will say my conclusion first; I think Only Fools Rush In is utterly a terrible film in any sense.
But it is not without any highlight; at least the music is good.
There are many types of terrible films; some make you sleep soundly in the cinema, some make you angry after watching it; Only Fools Rush In is like monkeys on Mount Emei; it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is super talented in insulting the audience.
The most painful part of the film is that it is hard to describe like a monster in Cthulhu novels, and has as many loopholes as the holes on the trench coat on Javier Mascherano.
After watching it, you may even wonder if there is metaphors the director planted in it; but you will find that it is only a piece of shit after close examination.
I’ll first briefly talk about some plots that are hard to understand.
The male leading role lives with his grandma on some island in the south.
His grandma has a wish, watching the snow, and the a old male neighbor drove a minibus to take her to watch the snow in the Northeast.
An elderly goes to watch the snow in the northeast from the south in a minibus? ?
He and his father were okay with it.
And then there is no follow-up on this old lady.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship; how does the brother of the female leading role get the license?
How do the racing bike gang on the island easily block a mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road just stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
They are obviously props.
Why could a little gangster biker with poor credit and who was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?
Why didn’t he call the police when there was usury involved, and the police specifically asked if there was any problem.
An adult who knows how to use smart phone doesn’t know how to use the card to open the door at the hotel, and it was forcefully arranged for him not being able to find the owner of the hotel and so he slept outside the hotel for the night?
Such ridiculous plots were everywhere in the film; the plots are so ridiculous that I feel painful when I remember them.
In addition to the plots, the theme of the film is even more terrible, or you can say there is no theme in the film; it’s just a horrible monster that is stitched together.
In the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy; after twenty minutes, you may guess it’s an inspiration film; after a half of it, you may think it’s a drama showcasing the hardship of a small town boy; after you watch all of it, you don’t even know what you have watched; what follows is deep doubt in yourself; why would you go to the cinema to watch a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
Most people are familiar with the routines of various films; for example, if you want to make a film about a biker, then make it an inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a love film, just tell the story about a small town boy who loves to ride motorcycle and a girl who works as a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then the plot should not have anything that is contradictory to the normal world.
(Such as the character played by Yin Zheng who sang after his new motorcycle was just burned ) please don’t think about ideas that are ridiculous.
As for why the female leading role acts like a five-year-old child when she is not retarded at all, I really don’t know if there is problem with her acting or it was demanded by the director.
And one more thing I don’t understand is why Han Han as a racer is so keen on adding the plot of car crash in his films?
Is such a film being arranged in the Spring Festival season to humiliate the audience?

Inspection shaft concrete module production and processing equipment, introduction to Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a specialized manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment, inspection shaft building block machinery and shaft wall module equipment, with semi-automatic and automatic production lines.
Based on practice and development of many years, it is engaged in production of high quality hydraulic type, mobile type and automatic inspection shaft series of equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection shaft concrete module production and processing equipment, the assembly site for Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment
Inspection shaft concrete module production and processing equipment, the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment
Yixin inspection shaft module brick equipment is widely applied in new-type masonry materials for municipal underground structures for coal, heating, electricity and gas.
Foe example: various types of inspection shafts, gutter inlets, box drains, septic tanks, small-sized structures and wing walls of bridges for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of building inspection shafts using concrete modules is that the four sides of the modules are of concave groove structures, which are built to form chain locks.
The shearing resistance of the shaft wall is far better than the masonry form of the flat friction of the brickwork.
The modules are of hollow structure, with connected holes vertically and interpenetrated horizontally; the cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed after pouring of the cores of holes, playing the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproof.
The joint bar grooves are equipped for modules vertically and horizontally; the horizontal and vertical joint bars can improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, phenomena such as collapse, sink or water leakage are rare in the inspection shafts and pumping shafts laid with concrete inspection shaft modules, with stable mechanical performance in shaft wall modules, easy operation and standard forming size.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment can automatically control the input and output of the configured data, and the one-key contact crystal display can monitor all the process of mechanical operation to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis on materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
Single-cylinder and double-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transportation are adopted for the shaft wall module mechanical and hydraulic system.
The independent hydraulic integration station is utilized to avoid the influences on the hydraulic system caused by vibration of the master so as to ensure reliability of the operation of the hydraulic system.
In the concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment, the fabric box proceeding box de-molds and lifts, the storage box door closes, and the supporting plate is transported automatically, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system so as to reduce mechanical abrasion and times of repair.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment is composed by imported computer and appliances, as well as sealing elements and hydraulic element to ensure stable and reliable comprehensive performance.
The integral steel plate is adopted for the shaft wall module mechanical vibration platform, with no welding points of wire-electrode cutting mold closing of mesa, so that the stuffing box can swing and orient freely to greatly reduce mechanical abrasion.
It reduces loads of molds and reinforces vibration; integrated and full synchronization are adopted for vibration of the platform and the molds to ensure the vibration effect.
The shaft wall module mechanical excitation machinery and the computer automatically control the vibration range according to the cost performance of raw materials, leading to no abrasion brake; in this way, it extends the service life and reduces the cost.
The shaft wall module machinery is equipped with dual functions, i.e., automatic control and manual control.

Doctors from South Africa: Although more transmissible, most of the patients infected by Omicron are mild cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that patients infected by Omicron are milder cases compared with those infected by Delta, although Omicron is more transmissible.
According to report from the Associated Press, as Omicron is being transmitted in South Africa, a report by a physician organization composed by more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa says that most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, such as body ache and cough, which are similar to symptoms of flu.
According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief supervisor of the organization, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said, “Their diseases can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after quarantine of 10 to 14 days.”
He said that those included aged patients and patients with health problems, who were easier to become severe cases due to infection of the COVID-19.
He said that, in comparison, the COVID-19 patients he treated in the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
Many of them needed to be hospitalized within only a few days”.
Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of Omicron the new variant in South Africa.
Although it will take some more weeks to collect sufficient evidence, observation and early proof from doctors have provided some clues.
According to the summary made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the last few weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which accounts for a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay at hospital is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which used to be as high as 20% in the cases of the early epidemic phase in South Africa.
By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, Director of Africa Institute of Health said, “At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a relatively mild disease.”
He also said: “However, it’s still at early stage, and we need to obtain data of later stage.
In general situations, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s only two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic.”
At the same time, scientists from all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as testing the effect of the current vaccines and treatment method.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 virus strain of the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries with South Africa at the center of the epidemic.
According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today; all 80 boxes have been given out!

Education news commentary: What should we do to rescue abducted children?
As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand of “buying abducted children”, if the masses can prevent and fight against abduction together and make abduction an action with no benefit, high risk and cost, then such crimes will not happen again.
Recently, the platform of emergency release of missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform established as an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and timely finding the abducted children.
I feel warm after hearing the App is named “reunion”.
This new technical means not only has an “artistic” name and full of warm feelings, but also makes appropriate use of informatization, making itself practical and effective.
The first and foremost objective of fighting against abduction is to find the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.
The judgment and punishment to the suspect is secondary.
In terms of the significance of criminal punishment, lots of “big words” can be listed from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education.
However, before solving an abduction case, the safety of the victims should be priority.
There are orders of priority; with the urgent goal of “rescue”, the discussion on contentious topics with divergent public opinions such as “if death penalty shall be applied to criminals of child abduction” can be shelved for now and be discussed with discretion; however, rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
According to the experience in solving such cases, human trafficking traders tend to run away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime.
Therefore, with each minute delayed in finding abducted children, the children are farther from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case also increases.
In this case, it is a practical action to present a platform such as “reunion” which can help solve the case and provide an effective method to find the children.
After all, cracking down on abduction is a major task that requires the coordination of the entire legal system.
To crack down on crimes and protect the interests of children and parents, the care of “protecting the young and helping the weak” shall be implemented in the improvement of legislation, and in safeguarding judicial system and meticulous enforcement.
In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from the perspectives of both family and society.
Take a common case as an example; parents and a child were taking a rest at the train station, and the parents found their child missing after waking up.
You cannot expect a 2-year-old child to protect himself/herself; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least some degree of protection awareness.
The father and the mother can take turns in taking rest, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the basic approaches for protecting children from being abducted.
Viewing from the other side of the crackdown on abduction, the party purchasing the abducted children shall be given attention to and punished, too.
Any single illegal behavior is usually one link of a long chain.
According to the Penal Code in our country, the criminal penalty starting point of child abduction and sale is 5 years; suspects with especially serious circumstance may be sentenced to death penalty with confiscation of property.
Under the trend of “light sentencing”, the crime of abducting and selling children has a high starting point and heavy maximum standard of sentencing, and thus it is clearly a crime with heavier sentence.
However, there are still lots of cases of abduction every year.
It is clear that some people are still lagging behind in the concept of raising children and have dim legal awareness.
Legal education should be provided to these people.
It requires not only strict enforcement from authorities to effectively control the crime of abduction and selling.
If the “market” of buying abducted children still exists, and abductors continuously create new ways to abduct children driven by the profits; this will lead to a situation where the criminals and law enforcers plot against each other, and the action to crack down on adduction will inevitably be low in efficiency.
Therefore, correcting outdated concepts and popularizing legal common sense are also conducive to eradicating the crime of abducting, trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong publicized the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC and the provincial congress of Party representatives.
Draw energy from the history of the 100 years of struggle of the Party

As pointed by Yang Haodong, it is necessary to combine the spirit of the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee and the spirit of the important instructions about Hunan by General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the spirit of the 12th Party congress of Hunan, to digest them and strengthen the guarding of the “two-establishment” and the ideological consciousness, political consciousness and action consciousness of the “two-guarding”, and to unwaveringly move forward in the direction pointed by General Secretary Xi Jinping.

Actually, I don’t what went wrong, the restaurant or the delivery person.
There is no receipt on the bag.
It can’t be traced.
I hope you can find out about it.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than what is displayed.
Nothing else, thanks.
Yes, the delivery person has been changed.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant always said they were processing it.
Waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, and five levels.
Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is oil obtained from fresh olive fruit after removing foreign matters by mechanical cold pressing and filtering.
There are three levels according to acidity:
Extra Virgin: is the highest level, best quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
It has premium taste, a slight and pleasant plant fragrance and a acidity of less than 1%.
Fine Virgin: has a slightly higher acidity of less than 2%, tastes pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin: taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined Olive Oil refers to olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, also called as “secondary oil”.
Refined Olive Oil can be divided into two categories:
Olive Oil: is refined olive oil mixed with virgin olive oil in a certain proportion to adjust the taste and color, has an acidity of under 1.5% and a transparent light gold color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil obtained and refined from pomace with dissolution method.
After reading the classification, you may find the acidity of olive oil is an important index.
You should know that olives are just like grapes that make wine, olives from different producing areas and different types of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best growing area of olives:
The Mediterranean coastal area has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity, precipitation and other weather conditions for olive growth.
Aside from the Mediterranean costal area, olives can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas in other areas.
Main producing areas (the Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are far away in the southern latitude and have similar climate.
Picking time of olives:
March to June each year is the time for olive trees to blossom and bear fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, and the color of fruit will transition from green to red, purple and finally black.
November to February of next year is the picking time of fruit (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is deemed the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils found so far.
The Summit for Democracy ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom would never extinguish
The online “Summit for Democracy” held by Biden, the U.S. president, and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and private sector from 110 countries came to a close on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in the closing speech that a dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.
He also said that the second global “Summit for Democracy” was scheduled to be held next year.
Tang Feng, representative of Taiwan government and member of the administrative council, and Luo Guancong, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, made speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, “We know that we are facing arduous tasks.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before and as what this Summit stands for, the world of democracy is everywhere.
A dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.”
Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were required to defend democracy.
He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, realize transparent accountability governance, so as to be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship as well as people who bluntly pursue power in front of public benefits.”
The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy” were strengthening human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy.
That day happened to be “International Human Rights Day”.
Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, “It’s the time to reiterate the common values, standpoint, as well as the tenacity of democracy.
Social dialogue needs to be deepened to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires us to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions.”
Luo Guancong, democracy and human rights activist from Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to continuously pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China including Uygur ethnic group and the Tibetans.
He said, “For a long time, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability.
This is the reason why there must be cooperation between politicians and civil society leaders.
We have to ensure that we will use all (the resources) we have to make the renaissance of democracy our primary task.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite together and fight against the threats from the Communist Party of China.
He said, “Some of you may be afraid of offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.
And this is the reason why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must make changes.”
When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Tang Feng, member of the administrative council of Taiwan, issued Country Declaration with a video to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared experience on how to fight against COVID-19 epidemic with transparent information and the construction of mutual trust.
He said, “As democracy in Taiwan is still making progress, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments from all over the world rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without putting cities on lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it.”
On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy”, Treasury Department of United States announced it would implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries including China and North Korea which were identified as having severely infringed on human rights; at the same time, it would implement investment restriction on a Chinese company which was identified as assisting in infringing on human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.
I have take a photo and submitted to you.
I know that.
But I don’t know why the restaurant kept putting off the delivery time.
It was originally #NUMBER#.
Anyway, I won’t do it.
I’m good now.
I will definitely make a complaint.
Why didn’t you say it earlier if you couldn’t deliver it?
I’ve waited so long for you.
No, I didn’t receive the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don’t want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
I’ve waited one and a half hours for one meal.
#PRS_ORG# is not delivered.
I want to cancel the order.
Why can’t I cancel it?
Hi, the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce delivered from the restaurant is raw.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I couldn’t stick with it, so I thought I would just find one at a suitable price to practice with.
It was not friendly; in fact, the price is usually in proportional to the degree of friendliness; if you are not able to distinguish, then expensive ones usually are more friendly than cheaper ones, and the so called “entry-level” rackets are in fact industrial garbage.
They are low in strength, and there will be too much vibration when the ball hits on it; it cannot withstand hard balls, and even professional cannot handle it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, we know you can’t learn to play it, and we know you're not willing to buy expensive ones, so we make a cheap one to fool you; you won't play it again after using it once or twice; since the racket is cheap, you don't feel it's a waste.
If you can tell the difference, it means you have made improvement; then you can come here to buy the expensive ones and I will make money twice.
I recommend you to spend the same amount of money on a better-quality second hand racket such as prince or DUNLOP; these two brands are not famous, and so even if they are good, they are not expensive; you can get a new one with 500 or 600 yuan and a second hand one with 200 yuan; isn’t it nice to have a thousand yuan racket with only so little money?
It’s friendly to newbies, but once you passed that stage, it will become not so useful; but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newbie stage.
The delivery time of the order has been put off multiple times.
Could you help follow up on it?
Delayed.
Thank you.
That is to say, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to re-place the order next? So I can just ignore the previous order, right?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, and after I received the delivery I found a lot of things were missing and the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce was raw.
#PRS_ORG# said I wanted to pick it up myself for no reason at all, please cancel it.
All my orders are delivery orders, and there has been no request of self pickup.

Actually, there are many tricks for slightly overweight girls to match their clothes.
Slightly overweight girls shall wear skirts not too long or too short; they shall be of the length at around the knees, just covering the fat part of the thighs.
The fat thighs will be shown if the skirt is too short.
Skirts that are too long will make you look short and fat.
If you are dressed in three sections, upper, middle and lower, you will naturally look taller; that is, use different colors for upper body, skirt and stockings, and you will look taller and slimmer.
In fact, a lot of darker color clothes are what slightly overweight girls all have, which the author deeply agrees; dark colors are good methods to cover fatness of your bodies; in addition, noble and elegant black short shirts are best choices for slightly overweight girls.
You will look slimmer in dark clothes, especially black short skirts.
Wear stockings and low-key shoes if your calves are fat.
The more common the better; the color shouldn’t be too bright.
In case people will notice your legs and feet and think you’re fat.
Slightly overweight girls shall master the tricks for clothing matching.
Slightly overweight girls shall never wear close-fitting short skirts and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or tucked inside the skirt, which seem strange; slightly overweight girls with thicker legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a flare skirt with print pattern and soft texture, and a loose-collar upper outer garment to cover the defects of the body.
Of course, there are some skills for slightly overweight girls to wear short skirts.
When slightly overweight girls wear short skirts, they shall choose upper outer garment with the same color as the short skirt, so as to make them look taller.
Wearing skirt with a pair of high heels will make your legs seem slimmer and longer, which is the most fashionable outfit in summer!
Girls with fat upper body and slim legs shall choose short dress of luxurious style.
It can not only cover the fat stomach, but also show your advantages.
A-line skirt makes people seem slimmer and is suitable for fat girls; it’s better to choose tight-fitting upper outer garment so as to form a sense of layers and make you look slimmer.
Fat girls can also try simple white T-shirt with short skirt.
Slightly overweight girls can be fashionable.
Slightly overweight girls can be the focus of attention as long as they master the clothing matching rules.
In addition to changes in matching outfits, slightly overweight girls need to do more exercises, and hopefully you will remove the label of slightly overweight girls sooner😄

Girl raises donations for elder sister by acting a target, saying “It’s ok since they are only flesh wounds” - Xinhuanet
A girl stood in front of a big plank, which writes “human target, 10 yuan for each arrow” at Wulin Square in Hangzhou.
Yesterday morning, a picture of “a girl in Hangzhou raises donation for her elder sister by acting as a target” went viral all over WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a plank slightly higher than a person, which writes “human target, 10 yuan for each arrow” at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, indicating that people can shoot with a bow and arrows after making the payment.
The behavior was discussed heatedly by people on the Internet.
Yesterday night, the person in charge of publicity at Xiacheng sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the journalist of the Beijing News that it was confirmed by the police that the girl did this in order to raise donations for her elder sister; however, this behavior should not be advocated, and the girl left from the local police station yesterday after being warned.
The girl who raised donations by acting as a target on the street was warned
In the picture appeared on the Internet, a girl with long hair was standing with her arms spread out in front of a big plank which writes human target, 10 yuan for each arrow” in black ink at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, and there was another plank in front of her which has the bank account, WeChat account and Alipay account on it.
The picture was discussed heatedly after it was posted on the Internet.
According to some netizens, this behavior is “begging behavior which aims to grab attention”, but many others show sympathy to her.
“We found her at about 10:00 am on the 23rd when we went on the patrol around the square, and there were already lots of onlookers.”
According to what the police officer of the Tianshui Police Station near the site told the local media, there were two young and beautiful girls in early 20s who set up a stall.
The girl acting as the “human target” kept crying, begging onlookers to play this game; the other girl was calling for attention on the side, saying that the elder sister of her friend suffered from leukemia and is in urgent need of operation fee, and asking onlookers to help her friend.
“We have gained contact with the police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising donations for her elder sister who suffered from leukemia.”
Yesterday night, the person in charge of publicity at Xiacheng sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the journalist of the Beijing News that this girl is named Ji Jiali, and she was raising donations for Ji Jiayan, her elder sister.
Since more than 300 thousand yuan was still required for treatment, Ji Jiali did this because she had no better way.
He told the journalist that one of the two girls acted as human target, and the other girl acted as an assistant and was not involved; nobody was found to have shot arrows during the whole process, and some onlookers only took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police sent it to the public security department and identified that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
According to the person in charge, “raising donations by grabbing attention is not advocated”.
She left from the police station after being warned by the police.
Heat dissipation: good; lightness: convenient; appearance and material: satisfactory; Acer has always been cost-effective.
The new laptop is very good.
The function is stable, and the heat dissipation of the four air outlets has no problem; it is worth recommending.
This Acer shadow knight dragon game laptop is pretty good with sufficient materials; it is a brand you can trust!
Acer shadow knight dragon is not expensive.
Personally, I think Acer shadow knight dragon is really good; game effect: playing games on it feels nice, you can play most games without any problem, and my high frame rate PUBG game was stable and smooth, and LOL was no problem at all; it can also let you play CSgo without any trouble and you can play most Three A games on it.
Heat dissipation: nice, the fan works well, it is quiet when you work on it, and it is louder with all the fans are working when you play games.
Appearance and material: the appearance looks cool; game laptops are eye catching; display effect: the screen is clear and 1080 is enough for playing games.

It looks beautiful and has good configurations.

But it was cost-effective and shipping was fast; I’ll make a follow-up review after using it for some time.

The laptop is good; the customer service staff is really nice; just ask them if you have any question; recommended.
Not bad, the image quality for playing games is really nice.
What is the hottest thing in 2021?
It was none other than the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there is an article titled Look! An article titled Olympic Disciplines in Which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals was viral, and it mentioned that project managers can be the foremost and unmatched in many disciplines, such as working arduously, going on business trips, and staying up late, the everyday work of project manager, and handling emergency, taking the blame and apologizing are nothing difficult at all.
A seemingly joking article also tells the bitterness of their daily work, and the hidden message is their insufficient energy to handle the current project management work.
People engaged in project management also gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in work by taking certain actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants each year, increasing project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the 20-year Development Report on China’s Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national PMP ® applicants totals 600,000, with 420,000 passed the PMP ® certification, and the number of valid certificate holders are about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of certificates of PMP ® in the world.
In the past ten years, the number of people holding PMP certificates keeps increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers realize it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying “past experience”; the rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can you ensure the smooth proceeding of project management work after passing the PMP test?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning courses of PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points such as the ten fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they are actually engaged in project management work.
Many project managers often reflect the following problems: project management awareness is not sufficient, relying solely on personal experience, and there is only project management theories and no ideas about how to practice them; lack of support of systematic project management process and system, unable to actually implement the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project being delayed again and again; the members’ division of labor is not clear, there’s no way to handle the “sophisticated ones” in the team, communication is not smooth between departments, and it is difficult to push the project forward...
Therefore, ZTCHINA, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D of management for more than ten years and helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of “China Enterprise R&D and Management Talents Training Demonstration Base”, presents the online course R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp.

Home Credit advocated rational consumption to consumers before the “Double Twelve” sale - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
During the “Double Eleven” festival this year, the amount of national online payment business transaction reached 1.77 trillion yuan, creating a new high when compared with that of previous years.
Various kinds of coupons and the eye-catching live-streaming sales once again make consumers feel they’ve gained benefits; this spending spree makes people feel amazed at the increasingly strong spending power of citizens; on the other hand, people need to calm down and think about the influences of consumerism on society and modern mainstream consumer groups.
Before the “Double Twelve” sale, Home Credit B.V. (hereinafter referred to as “Home Credit”) advocated rational consumption, reminding its users, especially young users, to develop good consumption awareness and habits, and reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the Report of Survey Analysis on Financial Literacy of Consumers published by People’s Bank of China this year, the financial literacy index of national consumers is 66.81, increased by 2.04 compared with that of 2019.
Generally speaking, citizens in our country have good performance on financial consumption; however, there are big differences in various aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and further improvement of popularization of basic financial knowledge shall be made.
Level of financial literacy of senior citizens and young people is relatively low, and they will still be the key objects of financial education; according to the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson and the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People from 2019 to 2020 issued by CTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading; 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt buildup; although there is a relatively rational consumption trend among the younger generation, which is drastically different from the label of “excessive squander” put on them by society, some young people indeed are involved in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even resulting in increasing social problems; financial enterprises shall shoulder their social responsibilities and guide young consumers in a positive way.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has always been engaged in helping citizens construct their own happy lives with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of the supervision units so as to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young consumers, with practical actions.
In the past years, Home Credit has been holding comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities aiming at young people, including university students; in addition, it has unconsciously offered reasonable guidance on the consumption demands of young groups by means such as cooperating with top universities in the country to host innovative practice competitions, so as to help students establish rational consumption concept and plan for consumption demands reasonably, and to assist them in accumulating life fortunes.
Upon the arriving of the “Double Twelve” sale, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish rational consumption awareness and correct concept of money, resist blind and excessive consumption, and avoid forming misunderstanding of loan for consumption, in case it will impact personal credit investigation and economic life in the future.
Be sure to plan in advance when making consumption, live beneath your means, and make repayment as schedule.
If it’s overdue, related overdue behavior will be recorded in personal credit report, which may lead to adverse influences on economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, be sure to choose authorized institutions and channels and check if related institutions have the qualification for operation.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to provide consumers with diversified services fitting their demands with mature and reliable consumption finance systems and constantly upgraded financial products, so as to improve the public’s financial knowledge level and help consumers develop the concepts of rational consumption and taking out loans in moderation, and be a consumption finance partner which consumers can trust for a lifetime.

Vietnamese People’s Daily Website - Gulf Cooperation Council tackle common challenges
The locations where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince stayed include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances imposed an embargo on Qatar in the middle of the year 2017 and led to the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implemented a full embargo; they blamed Qatar for supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions had a serious impact on the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, exerting a negative influence on economy of the countries and regions in that region.
The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, 2021, when the gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its boundary with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
Arab countries in the gulf aimed to resolve divergence; and restoring relations with Qatar originates from the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, so as to cope with common challenges.
During the period when the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land road passage between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
A passage of 725km connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding of cooperation worth 30 billion USD.
The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries happened as the negotiation was ongoing between Iran and major countries about saving a nuclear deal named Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Arab Gulf countries as it’s believed it cannot solve the missile issue with Iran.
All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term “competitor” and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as a “threat” to regional security.
According to the gulf countries, it is defective not to solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not to take actions to curb the activities of Iran in this region.
Under the backdrop where the nuclear negotiation between major countries and Iran was not able to meet the demand of the gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
The objective was to restrain the upgrading of the tense situations in this region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held soon will be the first summit for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar.
This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are being proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges and make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.

It is said to have the biggest exhaust noises of all supercars in Xinshan District!
The car that our team brings you now is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini’s flagship supercar and Murcielago’s next generation model, Aventador LP700-4!
It is priced nearly 2 million MYR and pays a road tax of around a dozen thousand each year; it is a four-wheel drive; why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower; can you image how fast that is?
Forget it, I don’t know, either; data says it takes only 2.9s to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h; when my myvi just reaches 30km/h, it is already at 100km/h, hum.
The low car body, extravagant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine transparent under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
The model doesn’t need much introduction; you can Google it yourself; I have prepared something Google won’t necessarily be able to provide!
It is too eye-catching; people look at it everywhere you go; it is uncomfortable! (It is actually sweet.)
Gas is around RM1 for 1km (the owner wouldn’t even care)
You need to practice the posture of when you get in and out of the car or it may be a little awkward (because you might get stuck halfway and crawl out).
The engine is so loud that you will turn deaf when you get out of the car. (But still, it’s sweet.)
The car body is too big; it will be narrow for it to park at a normal parking space; you will worry that the neighboring car might hit it while opening the door!
You may get lonely because there is no rivalry on the road (I made it up; it has nothing to do with the car owners, haha.)
Don’t get me wrong; the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Please contact us if you want to take a video for your car!
Know more about cars, come to The Car Guide.
A car crash involving tens of millions!
I believe car fans all know Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also over a million!
Recently, a car crashed into a million-level sports car 911 and a tens-of-millions level super car Chiron in just a few minutes in a foreign country!
It seems from the result that there’s a reason why it is so expensive!
Let university spirit resonate with spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
University spirit refers to a series of educational philosophy and pursuit of values an university accumulates in its long-term development; it is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, university spirit is indispensable in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology and society, as well as in the progress of a nation.
Since the establishment of the first real university in the world, universities shoulder unique missions which are different from other social organizations; universities in our country emerged in times of national crisis; its spirit is heavily influenced by traditional culture and the change of times; it advocates the values of “benefiting the world with virtue, and governing the country with integrity” and the patriotic responsibility of “building a strong country by studying”.
At present, with the increasingly prominent trend of informatization and globalization of higher education, competition of education, science and technology, and talent across the world are continuously fiercer; higher education is an important “supply end”, and the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially, the issuing of the General Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Disciplines showcases the confidence and determination of our country in the transformation from a giant of higher education to a strong country of higher education; at the same time, it also puts forward higher and newer demands on development of universities.
How to ascend to the top in the world within a short time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines while there is still a gap, and “overtake on a bend”?
In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the advantage of backwardness; through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, significantly improve the academic level and school running quality; the second one is the cultural advantage; inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and carrying forward excellent traditional culture, unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is system advantage; give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen objective driving, collect consensus and joining forces, optimize resource configuration, and provide sustainable and solid support for the university to speed up catching up with and surpassing the world advanced level.
It shall be especially noted that in order to construct world-class universities, the universities shall manifest their uniqueness and their own characteristics at the same time of giving full play to its advantages.
Running an university has to possess the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective positioning, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
For Zhejiang University, three characteristics are emphasized in our operation: the first one is to highlight the special training of innovation and entrepreneurship talents: construct integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, and the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of cross-discipline convergence: promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, build the environment of the cross-discipline system, and actively cultivate results of cross-discipline and emerging discipline research and landmark cross-discipline achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate forming the industry-university research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit, and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the university motto of “seeking truth and making innovation”, the common values of “study diligently, cultivate morality, foster discernment, advocate honesty” and the principles of “harboring generosity like the ocean, seeking the truth while upholding morality, being brave enough to keep exploring, and building our country” constitute the newest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
The university insists on the correct direction of running an university, continuously accumulates the altitude of culture and the important support by condensing the power of spirit; it has profound connotations and far-reaching significance.
In which, “harboring generosity like the ocean” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mindset of “inviting all talents”, which is manifested as absorbing the premium concepts of university operation and talent training of world famous universities; “seeking the truth while upholding morality” lays emphasis on the spirit of the pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall accept the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality while pursuing for truth; “being brave enough to keep exploring” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, as well as reform, development and innovation; “building our country”stresses the spirit of patriotism and dedication, meaning that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
These spiritual ethos and the pursuit of values are the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of university running.
“Wise people can hear when there is only silence and see before things are formed.”
Universities and colleges in China shall further master the direction of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of top universities in the world.
At the same time, hold fast to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, spirit of the times and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide infinite power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and the common ideal of all human beings.

As NFT went viral beyond its own circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity has exerted a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet grooming game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT, and it is the NFT project with the highest trading volume now, exceeding US $3 billion so far.
Data of TokenTerminal shows that the daily income of Axie Infinity exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said their daily active users have surpassed one million.
The hotness of Axie Infinity has sent the new “palytoearn” pattern to more people; with the help of blockchain and intelligent contract, players are no longer a single character, and in addition to gaining pleasure and economic revenue from the game, they can also participate in the governance of game ecosystem.
The subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
I read a piece of news about one of my friends’ stock price, and my biggest feeling is the how the enterprise chooses its track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry; first of all, they should choose a industry with a large space for development and a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the scale of market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is easy or bumpy refers to the competitiveness landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first task is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The key of the tactics is “do the things right”.
The key of the strategy is “do the right thing”.
Strategy lies in finding direction and tactics lies in implementation; above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After coming into being 12 years ago, bitcoins ushered in several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small country, El Salvador, in Central America designated bitcoins as a legal tender, and this is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States approved the launch of bitcoin ETF by ProShares company for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the perspective of blockchain technology, bitcoin is not the leading role.
On November 14, 2021, bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called Taproot, which improved the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day.
According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.
According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process.
As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants.
Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts.
They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students.
The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet.
Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US.
I need tableware.
I just canceled the order.
Why is it still in progress?
Can you check for me if it has been canceled?
But I placed the order at 5:9 in the morning.
That was the order hotline, and they said they didn’t know anything.
Is there a number I can call to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant located at Yuyao Zhangting Village in Zhejiang through an estate agent and decided to purchase it after seeing it on-site for a few times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the house owner, about the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. ”
However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract.
Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn’t want to sell it anymore.
For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People’s Court.
After the hearing, the court held that the two parties failing to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed; therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract and return twice the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed again.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Reminder from attorney] In the process of trading, we should perform necessary duty of prudence.
When signing the contract, the buyer should perform necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the “Democracy Summit” on Friday, the spokesperson of Foreign Ministry of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11), stating that the United States hosting the “Leaders’ Democracy Summit” to “make democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy in the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation and to shift domestic contradictions”.
According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has been imposing its own political systems and values on others, carried out ‘democratic transformation’, used unilateral sanction indiscriminately and has instigated ‘Color Revolution’, leading to disastrous consequences.
“Democracy has long become the weapon of mass destruction the United States used to interfere with other countries.
The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.
The meetings during the 2-days summit were held via video call, and leaders from 111 countries were invited to attend the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited.
China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There were doubts internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for inviting leaders who had the tendency to be authoritarians, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspected that the real intention of the Biden government was geopolitics, not democracy.
German Chancellor Scholz who just took office also attended the video Democracy Summit.
According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “the American democracy today is morbid, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital.
The U.S. President, Biden, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability and governance, to fight against the power of impact of buffer of autocracy and those who bluntly pursue power before public benefits.”
He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, “we must keep update it in every generations which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era.”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights are “facing continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy should be guarded by fighters”.
The United States promised that after this Democracy Summit, it will carry out a series of year-long actions including a 424.4 million USD initiative to strengthen democracy around the globe and provide support to independent new media.
The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and open promises before the democratic summit held at the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
Biden said, “let’s all fulfill our promises and report our progresses next year”.
OK, I just worry that he will deliver it to the wrong address.

Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students in Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to leaders of the university to reflect their confusion on examinations in university, and raised the ideas to increase the difficulty of examinations, change types of questions and let the examinations reflect the real learning level of students.
Indeed, examinations in universities have been a “heated topic“ for a long time.
Students on campus come from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels; due to different efforts spent in study, their situations of study vary significantly.
It is inevitable for different feelings about the examinations to exist in such a diversified group.
Certainly, it will cause a completely different experience if there are few types of questions, the questions are repetitive or too simple.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.
As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where “slack students” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.
In this way, the problems in college exams reflected by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not groundless; it is believed that such situations do not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud for the three students who wrote the letter to reflect the problem directly.
In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring “key tutoring” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.
In the view of the author, as a guidance for teaching quality evaluation, judging if the exams in a college are qualified or not relies more on the comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the setting questions scientifically on this basis.
Majors are segmented after entering the undergraduate study, and many specialized courses are carried out with basic knowledge as the main content.
Undoubtedly, whether the students have mastered the basic knowledge is a content to be inspected in the exams in college.
Knowledge during the undergraduate study is mainly basic theories and common sense of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, they are basically unchanged and there is not much room for variation.
As some teachers have said, “the mathematical basic knowledge in college twenty years ago is still being taught today and it is still a key content.”
However, the unchanging basic knowledge points do not mean there can be single type or repetitive questions.
There will usually be a group working on setting test questions for the exams, and senior teachers of the subject will coordinate and compile a test paper; marking test papers will be undertaken by all teachers of the subject; this can in a sense overcome the situation of repetitive questions.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.
College exam is the baton of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exams will influence the effect of college education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter of advise from the students; it has deployed the scheme for rectification in the university.
It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to deliberate and conduct self-inspection on exams at the end of a course, formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and review, specify grade evaluation work, and strengthen comprehensive inspection on various links of course teaching.
Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.
If you cannot change the location of the branch store for me, can I change it to delivery?

Mrs. Gold Wedding Dress Photography (Nanjie Store) has no branch store yet.
Because I didn’t arrange my time well before the shoot, I rescheduled twice and consultant Lanlan patiently arranged time for us.
Later we chose a weekend with nice weather to shoot it.
The staff at Mrs. Gold, no matter it’s consultant or makeup artist, are fantastic.
That was the first time that I had officially put on makeup and wow, I couldn’t even believe that I could be so pretty one day, haha.
Xiaojie and the other girl (sorry, I forgot her name) were super patient while doing my makeup and the makeup was natural.
We shot the outdoor scene at Jiangwancheng, and fortunately the weather was nice that day, we didn’t feel cold; during the shoot, makeup artist was paying attention to our clothes, headwear, and made adjustment immediately once there was a problem.
The photographer was funny, and we were happy throughout the day.
When choosing the photos, I saw many cases online where they wouldn’t let the customers delete too many photos, but they didn’t ask us to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the set and nothing more (I heard that my cousin who was also taking wedding dress photos added photos worth over 10,000 in addition to the 7,000 yuan set, and I was stunned and feared I might choose too many).
The editing was finished today and Lanlan sent it to me; I felt two were not good enough and they immediately re-edited them for me.
I found the old photos of my sister to make comparison, and I felt that our photos were really satisfying, simple and fresh, exactly what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend choosing Xuanhan Mrs. Gold to take your wedding dress photoshoot!
Set price: 3,999 yuan
Mrs. Gold is grateful for you and sincerely wishes you a happy life and a promising future!
How much is this set?
Then what are the conditions for using the $32 one?
That’s fine, and there is no need to refund it.
Your delivery person said it couldn’t be found.
Can’t find it.
But I don’t understand his English.

3200 new infants in Sabah have no birth certificates because of the supply shortage of the specially made security paper.
(Kota Kinabalu News on the 11th) According to the National Registration Bureau of Sabah, new infants cannot be provided with birth certificates from the beginning of October due to supply shortage of the specially made security paper; a total of 3,200 infants have been influenced so far.
However, director of the bureau, Kerouaminus, promised that the data of all the infants applying for birth certificate has been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued as soon as the security paper arrives next week.
He made the explanation at the press conference regarding to an online media’s report that the paper shortage of birth certificates in Sabah has been going on for ten months.
He said that related problems started 2 months ago, and that Sarawak is also facing this problem.
“One of the reasons is that the manufacturers of the security paper in China are influenced by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to our country.”
He explained that the security paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from that of other regions, and therefore stock in other regions cannot be borrowed.
Kerouaminus disclosed that the latest batch of security paper has been delivered to Kuala Lumpur on December 6, and was handed over to the printing company on December 8 for part of the printing work.
“The National Registration Bureau of Sabah will dispatch staffs to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to complete the printing of the last stage after returning to Sabah, and it is estimated that they can be given out to the applicants at most 2 working days later (December 20).”
“We’ll notify the applicants to get the birth certificates at their local branch bureau.”
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
I’ve been waiting since 7 o’clock.
Will it arrive soon?
I meant the food.
I waited again across the #PRS_ORG#.

The battery is powerful, works 9 nines between charges, and using it for 4 hours is no problem at all; in all, I feel happy to buy such a quality machine at this price, and I will add review of other functions later.
The appearance is good.
I’ll comment on its functions after using it for some time.
The machine is fast and bigger than I imagined; it worked great doing picture rendering; I like it, and I’ll make a follow-up review after using it for some time.
Not bad, I could search the serial number of the laptop on ** of Hong Kong, so the quality should be OK.
** feels not big, but heavy, and it feels not that big when you hold it with one hand; it is slightly bigger than 15.6 inch one and works stably; there is basically no stuttering; I love the sound of the fan doing heat dissipation; it sounds nice, and the fans won’t work all the time like game laptops.
It is good, a lot cheaper than the Official Flagship Store, and they gave a backpack as a gift; I think it is pretty good.
The seller’s service is also good; they reminded me to update bios and timely issued the **.
Deserving!
Hear dissipation: hear dissipation is very good, basically no heat at all; lightness: easy to carry; appearance and material: tradition design of Thinkpad, satisfactory.
A trusted seller; I’ve checked the appearance of the whole laptop and all the interfaces carefully and found no trace of being renovated or used; it is indeed a brand new American version laptop, and the configurations are the same as listed on the page.
The seller forgot to send the backpack and re-dispatched one for me immediately; although it is not a backpack from the original factory, the seller was trustable due to good after-sales services.
If my friend needs to buy a laptop, I will come back and buy again.
Appearance and material: luxurious ; display effect: the screen resolution is good, clear; lightness degree: it is slightly heavy, after all, heavier things feel better.
Heat dissipation: I just started using it and will come back and comment later.
The keyboard is good for typing, and a mouse and a converter are given as presents; the configuration is economical when compared with the Chinese version, cheap and fine in general; I’ll give further comments on its performance after using it for some time.
The screen is really dope!
It works smoothly, and I’ll make a follow-up comment after using it for some time!

The point is I didn’t eat anything tonight.
If it can’t be delivered, just say it sooner.
President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: It is firmly believed that China is capable of hosting a successful Winter Olympics during this special time - Xinhuanet
Message from Sarajevo of Xinhuanet on December 11, Kvesic, president of Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, said recently that Bosnia was looking forward to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and firmly believed that China is capable of hosting a successful Winter Olympics during this special time.
Ji Ping, ambassador of China in Bosnia and Herzegovina, met with Kvesic, president of Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, in Sarajevo Olympic Center a few days ago.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke positively about the relationship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and China; when he visited China during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, the excellent organization work of the Chinese left him with a deep impression, and he firmly believed that China is capable of hosting a successful Winter Olympics during a special time; Bosnia was looking forward to Beijing Winter Olympics, and Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee was actively organizing representatives to attend the Olympics; Bosnia and Herzegovina wished to take it as an opportunity to develop wider exchanges and cooperation with China in the sports field.
According to Ji Ping, there is a special “Olympic bond” between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Sarajevo Winter Olympics was held successfully here in 1984, and Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will open in two months, showing a simple, safe and splendid event to the whole world.
Both countries are expected to deepen exchanges and cooperation in terms of winter sports event preparation and athletes training, and the embassy of China in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to serve as a bridge to promote exchanges in humanity between the two countries by taking Beijing Winter Olympics as the opportunity, so that the people of the two countries can “work together for a shared future”; the embassy wished that athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina could acquire good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the awards ceremony for “the 10th Best Athletes of the Year”, and Ji Ping awarded the prize for the best young athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a special guest.
The publicity video of Beijing Winter Olympics was played repeatedly on the site of the activity.
So disappointed.

Negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours and setting up a "buffer zone", the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice about strengthening epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, asking people who recently left land border port cities (except those connected with ports of Hong Kong and Macao) to hold the negative result of nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and people who go to the land border port cities should take the nucleic acid test at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the aforementioned request is from the date when the province, autonomous region and city determine the scope of port cities and announce it until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.
According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost.
Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation.
The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases.
The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube video uncovers the truth of US army’s bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet
(source of video: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary named Killing Machine went viral on YouTube.
The documentary tells of various kinds of antihuman crimes committed by the US, including launching the war against Afghanistan in the name of “anti-terrorism”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, exhausting its resources to build up its military power, being obsessive about bloodthirsty killing, and massacring the innocent at will for 20 years.
The US army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing squad with distorting human nature.
The US army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years.
The US army set up “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”.
Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from even more Afghan civilians.
Just as what the video says, American anti-terrorism war “is creating more terrorism”.
The war did not bring peacefulness, democracy, prosperity or hope to Afghan people; instead, they threw the country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.
Let us click on the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism” of the US, and rip off the false mask of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life; although canning is deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text perhaps can explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and gained contact with many production lines of milk powder.
Actually, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and in cans are exactly the same.
Then you may ask: why is the shelf life of milk powder one year in bags and two years or longer in cans?
Or you may ask: why are the prices of bagged and canned milk powder so different?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, and people just think the goods are more expensive because they are better.
There are also customers in this mindset who say that the taste is indeed different after drinking it!
Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive.
Why are the prices so different when the raw materials are the same?
When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on?
Therefore, in the price setting of the canned ones, they set it much higher to guarantee their profits.
As a result, many manufacturers recommend canned ones instead of bagged ones.
Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year.
Everyone knows it.
With the development of society, the market promotion expenses kept increasing, such as the cost of promotion personnel at shopping malls, the display expenses of products at shopping malls, the cost of gifts of products, advertising expenses, etc.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products in can packaging, and the price kept rising as well; in fact, these new product are introduced due to the increase of market costs.
The main objective is to gain more profits; the increased cost of raw materials is actually no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, cooperate with doctors in the hospital by all means, and ask them to assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from one can.
China’s relevant laws by no means allow such operations because this practice is in fact harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans if you have cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation time and hermetic seal of milk powder; it won’t have any influence on the children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned ones is longer than that of bagged ones; the shelf life of canned ones is the same as that of bagged ones after unpacked; it’s just that bagged ones are not easy to be preserved and are easy to become damp and deteriorate.
The delivery was late, and after the food got cold, it was dry and hard, completely inedible.
Also the soup was spilled.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff he #PRS_ORG# resends here must be cold.
I didn’t take it!
#NAME# said no one went to pick it up.
We called.
I’ll call the police if you don’t refund it.
I’ve used #PRS_ORG# many times, and today I had the worst experience.
Totally unacceptable.
Okay, fine.
But you need to remind the restaurant and delivery person.
To prevent it from happening again.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
The time kept being put off.
I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait.
If I cancel the order, can I get the money back?
I want to pay service fee to the delivery person, how can I do it?
It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a delivery person.
Not willing to wait any longer.
Don’t scare people off at the starting line - Xinhuanet
We can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores.
Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle”, which first assumes or implies that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what it is” that you need to do.
It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it”.
As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are.
The “best principle” will make every reader believe it is “absolutely right”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people.
Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.
The majority of people will be timid in front of “change”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to “change” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent.
From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity”.
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people “sigh at the beginning”.
Or, the “second best principle” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful.
The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.
Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all.
Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere,
It’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle”.
In all, although the “best principle” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the “second best principle” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.
Do I need to re-place the order now?
The phone was not answered.
Kept being delayed.
Still not delivered.
May I ask when it will arrive?
How do I gain contact?
Please cancel the order.
I can’t wait any longer, thanks.
He still has two food orders to deliver, but one order has completed.
I want to know how to contact the delivery person.
The first delivery person told me that another delivery person would send it again.
The reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in the Qinghai Lake have increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
Report from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Gymnocypris przewalskii, commonly known as “scaleless carp”, is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an indispensable role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water, fish, bird” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, gymnocypris przewalskii was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
From 2003, Qinghai province implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing gymnocypris przewalskii in the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of gymnocypris przewalskii and their products.
In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.
Qinghai three-rivers area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of fishing ban of “one river, one river, and one lake”.
I ordered food worth over $180 with #PRS_ORG# RED credit card.

The restaurant only gave me one bag of it, and it needs to be put in a bag because it’s cold.
May I ask if the food delivery was put in one bag?
We only see one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or someone took it, thanks.
It has been 1 hour and it still has not been delivered yet.
I just read an article about period, and it’s too long.
I’ll introduce to men who don’t know about it.
Most girls will get their first period between 13 to15 years old, and have amenorrhea around 50.
Then they get period regularly once every month on the premise of good health.
But it is not so regular that you can precisely predict it; there is a difference of around a week; you need to prepare early and sometimes you may get unlucky and it arrives several days earlier.
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person; some people have it for three days and some people a week; some people have small flow and some people have way too much; some people don’t have any reaction, and some people feel so painful that they have to be taken away by the ambulance; dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not having it before doesn’t mean it won’t happen for a lifetime.
You can’t control menstruation; you bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is absorb blood with pads or tampons to prevent it from getting onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins; Taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of dysmenorrhea that month before menstruation begins, but taking it is useless to after dysmenorrhea begins.
It is easy to have diarrhea before the period due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If you are near the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason at all, you will basically get your period within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria; apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, and that is 42 pieces; if you add the ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not just one piece every month.
(a little modification here, tampons do not need to be changed often; it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may make you irritable, and ovulation may also make you emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very troublesome; your body makes itself suffer.
However, you may see from the official crime rate data that women’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It’s not just blood, but also endometrium that fall off.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens; you may think that the uterus is a house; you build a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests, and if the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstruation flows out) and a new house is built next month, which starts again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; you bleed 24 hours a few days a month for dozens of years, and it also causes abdominal pain and lower back pain; who would want that?
But people are born because their mother has menstruation; menstruation exists to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months before you come to this world; everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed; society brainwashed women and told them it’s dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that; but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, the female body’s preparation for life is disgusting, and it shouldn’t be said in public; girls, stand up and don’t think this way; men who have never experienced it, won’t experience it in this life, and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and unkind; how can you face your mother and children in this attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons; they are really easy to use.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
Please place another order for the children.
I hope the store can set aside some time out of its busy schedule to check the quality of the products.
Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?
Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.
As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.
According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.
“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!”
Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.
Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.
Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.
Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.
Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.
But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.
There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.
Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Headline of viewpoints - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Message from Hunan Daily on December 10 (all-media journalists: Zhang Shangwu and Hu Panpan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, photographer: Li Jian) The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Introduction and Marketing Event were held in Hunan International Expo Center this morning to exhibit tea industry, innovate tea science and technology, advocate tea culture and accelerate the process of realizing the industry objective of 100 billion.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Head Office, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Provincial People’s Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: Xinhua is the source of Hunan Black Tea, and the emerging of the black tea injects new energy into the “colorful Hunan tea”.
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the Hunan tea industry of 100 billion and formed the development pattern of “three Xiang, four rivers, and five colors of tea”.
The tea industry of the province has been promoting innovation, and main tea types such as green tea and black tea take turns to generate power; tea-travel integration is promoted in main tea production areas to drive income increase of tea farmers.
Every type of tea takes turns to gain its spotlight, and now it is time for black tea.
According to opinion of experts in the tea industry in the province, tea farmers pick black tea after green tea and have income in all four seasons, making the  production value of tea gardens soar.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of “Hunan black tea”, and Xinhua was awarded the title of “source of Hunan black tea”.
In the exhibition hall of Xinhua black tea, a tea merchant from Fujian took a fancy to a high mountain tea named “spring in ice” and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of provincial tea association, said happily that factors such as epidemic exert an impact on the tea market to a certain extent; however, based on the situations at the tea expo, there are various highlights.
The red color of Xinhua black tea has instilled the essence of tea culture, and with its popularity and hot transactions, the Hunan tea industry is ushering in a new spring.

Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, but only through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of Metaphysics originates from “the metaphysical is the Tao, and the physical is vessel” in the Book of Changes, Texts of Hexagrams, and was translated from metaphysic by Japanese Kajiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extended questions.
Ontology is the “study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept”.
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of keeping silence about God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between “mind and body”.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline which carries out systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), normative ethics (judge different moral concepts, and to give moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the research where ethical theory is applied to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics), descriptive ethics (collect information about how people live, and summarize from the observed patterns.
Its examination on ethics does not originate from the expected theory, but it investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors leading to this decision; it studies the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
Part II: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant, Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham, Sikivik et al., 19th century, Britain National evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer, Huxley, et al., late 19th century, German Neo Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier et al., late 19th century, Neo Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green et al.), transitional Ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche et al.).
Logic is a discipline which studies “the principles and standards of valid argument and proof”.
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline which studies the essence and significance of beauty.
#NUMBER# yuan has been received, and it was for the missed food.
Yang Xingche, real name Jiang Bo, was born in the month of the sheep in the year of the sheep; the name Yang Xingche means the sheep feel most comfortable when they are on grass; people call him Uncle Yang (Sheep in Chinese).
He is called “thriller genius” in the industry due to the publication of his “Foreign Password” series including Strange Stories in Thailand, Strange Stories in India, Strange Stories in Japan and Strange Stories in Korea, and he said that he’s “good at talking serious nonsense”
Darkness under the Light, also known as Strange Stories in China, a brand new work from the “thriller genius”, allows you to experience the essence of Chinese folk customs; what are the sad, beautiful and moving stories behind the legends passed down until now?
Nan Xiaolou and Yue Wuhua, the “travelers of a different journey”, start the risky travel of secrets exploration, and their life stories will be revealed soon.
Yang Xingche, the “thriller genius”, worked until his hair turned gray to contribute a million bestselling books!
The authentic Strange Stories in China, a brand new work after the “Foreign Password” series, has the same author and the same leading actors; it extends the unfinished stories of Strange Stories in Thailand and Strange Stories in India!
One thing was missing, and even the McNuggets was charged.
Ask the restaurant to send it up here.
I don’t want to go downstairs to shop, which is why I spend so much in delivery.
Ding Zilin: to friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the death of our family, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994.
Now the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up, started working and got married.
It is your chivalrous deeds that have helped these families in distress pass the most difficult time.
At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to the family of victims, Tiananmen Mothers group; this humanitarian relief event should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will remember your kindness forever and firmly believe your chivalrous deeds will be remembered by history forever.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way; please understand!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Yean: please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are parallel organizations, and there are often intersections between the project executors.
(Apple Daily photo: Tiananmen Mother website is managed by Tao Ye. ) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The relief funds often fail to reach the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement successfully.
In 1994, Ding advised that the “Tiananmen Mother” set up a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan Education Fund”; after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from University, MCDF then established the “June 4th Elderly with No Family Destitute Poverty Relief Fund”, which has been implemented until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations of generous individual donations in the year of June 4th event, and were supported by the democracy foundation of brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a part of the donation made by Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief project.
We understand that Ding called a stop to the June 4th donation for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed retired elderly, and our income is not as much as before; we hereby thank teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the decision of the family of the victims and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous fellows who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.

Normally the administration office downstairs would call me when there’s a delivery and let the delivery person in after asking me, but administration office has not contacted me.

Member reviews
[Effect] Photo effects: I shot two outfits, and it was overall nice; I prefer the outfit on this picture~
[Service] Service details: I was uncomfortable doing makeup because I was pregnant, and the makeup artist and staff were considerate enough to have me rest for while and keep pouring warm water for me.
Set price: 1,000 yuan
Thanks to Tuzi for commenting; I thought I would say no to the ancient style because it didn't suit me, unexpectedly the results were stunning.
Thanks to Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction will keep us going forward, and we will keep making improvement!
This photography studio is truly great, highly recommend it for everyone!
It was impeccable, no matter it’s reception, makeup, outfits, lighting or photography.
The makeup artist was attentive to details and would choose the makeup most suitable for you based on your style; the makeup products were also from leading brands.
Not to mention Tian Liang, who is really a professional photographer.
The whole studio is artistic, and there are two kittens to play with you.
We work in Beijing, and better studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance; I have a colleague who did the photoshoot in Beijing and felt the photos were just so so.
I specifically found this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management was poor, and I think this is a problem for most people, but photographer Liang is good at capturing the natural and wonderful moments.
A brilliant team with makeup artist, photographer and post-editing design.
After the photos came out, we and everyone around us were full of praises for them.
I have recommended my girlfriend to come, who was also satisfied with the photos.
I hope studio like this will get the attention it deserves and more people can discover it and shoot photos with their own style instead of being the same as everyone else.
Thank you to Zhanying and Jinglung for your five-star reviews, you are both creative new comers; we are a creative studio, and as long as customers like it, we will give our 200% to do it; we are grateful for meeting you.
Everyone on the team was nice, the sweet assistant, the lively photographer; it was a wonderful and unforgettable experience, and the photos were so much better than what I imagined them to be; thank you so much to everyone for your great efforts😘😘
Thank you to Xiaoyu for your review, it was destiny to have met you; from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is as long as the several thousand kilometers road; I am happy to get acquainted with you and hope you can come back to Qinhuangdao.
How should I pay?
The de-delivered food has arrived.
No delivery person received it.
Now the restaurant employee is calling me.
I am a programming newbie and I want to share my experience.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to get some training , but if you don’t want to, it’s better to study on your own; after all, trainings are expensive and it will take you six months to learn it.
However, if you want to enter this industry, then training is a great option, especially for those who are extremely not self-disciplined.
You can choose to teach yourself if you are self-disciplined, but it will be tiring.
Certainly, selecting a good training agency is very important.
You need to first look at the faculty of this agency; if it’s not strong enough, you can cross that agency off your list; of course, some new agencies don’t have strong faculties.
Secondly, you shall do some research on the agency before choosing it; it’s best to contact former students of the agency; after all, only students know how the agency really is and whether the curriculum is good or not.
Hello, actually I’m not sure how to answer your question since you didn’t introduce your own situation, and learning this is closely related to your situation.
Such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you are in; all of these are related to what you want to learn or what industry you want to go into.
If you are a student who haven’t graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, then I recommend learning it yourself if you have time, and this is the method with lowest efficiency and cost; many offline and online training agencies are good now, but it comes with great cost and takes a lot of time; it basically needs a concentrated training of three to six months.
However, if you are in the same situation as I mentioned, it is convenient to learn it yourself; many learning resources are free online, or you can gain access to a lot of training resources on Bilibili; if you don’t know how to search for them, you can contact me according to my bio and get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also classic books to supplement your study with videos.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay certain amount of money and devote your time to your learning, then I suggest you go to an agency to study; it’ll be easier this way as the teachers will explain in detail and there will be designated people answering your questions; in addition, it’ll be helpful to your study planning or help you get supervision.
Further, many training agencies will sign employment agreement; they have quota for internal promotion, and you can be recommended to a company after your learning, so that the job interview process can be easier.
The above is my opinion; as I said, I don’t know about your situation so my introduction is not detailed; if you want to consult other things, you may contact me any time.
I said it should arrive before 1 o’clock, and I’ve seen it in the App.
What is the...
I haven’t finished speaking, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of housekeeping services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall mounted water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, and professional sewing.
Thanks to everyone who liked my post; I will carry on working hard although life is difficult.
Life will not let hardworking people down; follow me if you like me; thank you to everyone who have liked my post.
This is life; others only see the result and you must go through it alone; in the face of life, we can only stay strong and carry on; there is no other choice; you can look back on life, but you cannot relive it...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is more beautiful with services, and services are wonderful because we work hard.
Although we do the most dirty work in cleaning, we will try to clean all the corners of the client’s house with our hard work; the moment I see the client’s smile and big thumb up, all the efforts spent are worthwhile; your hard work will pay off!
My daily work
- your requirements, my service.
Keep the beauty with attentive service and cleaning.
Feng Gui Housekeeping will try our best to care for the details you care about and love your house with our services.
Keep thousands of houses clean, establish a brand of housekeeping; standard service, in-house cleaning.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp looks luxurious, it will be dim if it has not cleaned for a long time; only after cleaning, can it shine brightly, and so is life.
Do it with heart and we can succeed; we are serious about creating exquisite things with our attention to details, and we are serious about cleaning seams.
Give me a chance and you will be satisfied; quality is everything, because professionalism is worth trusting; your recognition is the best encouragement to me!
At present, there is not one industry that is easy to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be slightly better than others; it’s at least better than sitting around and complaining!”
Morning is the most important time of the day; all the good things begin in the morning; I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and joy; keep a good mood all day long; good morning.
When we were children, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it; when we grow up, happiness is a goal, and we will be happy when we reach it; after maturity, I found that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding is happiness.
Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and leave no regrets in your life; life is a road, go your own way; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, and you will live a beautiful life!
We will encounter different difficulties in different stages of life.
Often times, what is restraining you is not you ability but your courage to face it actively.
Since you cannot hide, you’d rather face it.
The more scared you are, the easier you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you take it head on, the problem will be solved.
Exhibition planners of China and Saudi Arabia work together to hold the first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (journalists: Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia, Diriyah contemporary art biennale, was officially opened to the public in the JAX arts district of Diriyah in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on December 11, and a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries and regions participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is planned jointly by Diriyah biennale foundation of Saudi Arabia and UCCA of China, and Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA of China, works as the art director.
According to the introduction from the planning team, the theme of the biennale is “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, which is a metaphor of the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situations of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennale occupies an area of nearly twelve thousand square meters, and the exhibition hall stretches across six connected buildings with six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as an Experiment, Thinking at the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New Word and On the Spirit of Arts.
In which the number of the works of the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including various art forms such as drawing, installation art and performing art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists create with recycled materials in an innovative way; for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with wastes in Behind the Story Series, Picture of Endless Streams and Mountains (2014).
According to Buckley, CEO of Diriyah biennale foundation, it is hoped that the biennale can establish an international dialogue, provide global audiences with opportunities to understand the vigorously developed culture industry and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said, “The biennale has two objectives, i.e., establishing dialogue between contemporary art of Saudi Arabia and the world, and integrating audiences of Saudi Arabia into the contemporary art world.”
It is understood that there will be a series of lectures during the biennale, and artists, exhibition planners and leaders of innovative industries will engage in discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.
I ordered axe-handle steak.
The restaurant told me the delivery person could not deliver bones.
I want to ask why.
The bones are okay, ask the restaurant to wrap them up separately and deliver them.
But the system was not easy to use, and I normally used the other room.
I’m at #ADDRESS#, the branch store at Meixinli.
I’m far from that place.

Message from Xinhua News Agency Kunming on December 12 (journalist: Lin Bifeng): In order to continue to provide assistance to the employment of people lifted out of poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation work, Yunnan Province has released policies on the management of public welfare position in villages for promoting rural revitalization, as a way to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.

The address is wrong.
Hello,
Can I cancel the order?
I will re-place the order.
Is it canceled yet?
2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist.
But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in.
4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards.
Let’s talk about Leftists.
Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it’s necessary at all.
Don’t try to reason with rebels and crazy Leftists; they are all one track minded and unreasonable.
Don’t try to prove we are right, and don’t even think about asking rebels and crazy Leftists to admit it; why bother?
I told my friends: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent and when the leftist call you a rightist dog, they prove we are on the correct track in the middle!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but they forgot about them when they got older; or, they pursue their dreams and become paranoid.
They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom; the innate genes of China’s history and culture make China overall relatively left.
The domestic Rightists are free and stress efficiency and development, while the Leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society overall hopes to pay more attention to justice; at the same time, it is certain that when China and the United States fight, it is bound to lean towards left, which is estimated to continue for many years.
Just like it if you don’t understand.
No need to say more, Huahua is generous.
In the past two years, the blockade and interception of the US on Huawei chips not only made Huawei fall into an unprecedented difficult position but also made “American” enterprises suffer from huge losses.
The US suppresses China’s chips industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of its allies to block China’s chip industry at the same time; the direct consequence was that the number of orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in the decrease in the investment of research and development and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which further led to the disorder of chip supply chain shortages on a global scale.
Today, “lack of chips” has affected all major industries of the world, resulting in the suspension of production of car enterprises and rise in prices of mobile phones; almost all the industries using chips are greatly impacted.
To gain the right to make their own decisions on “chips”, more and more countries’ tech giants are taking the path of “de-Americanized”.
In order to firmly holding the right to control global semiconductor in its hands and pin down the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States have made frequent moves recently such as hosting the “chip summit”, inviting the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocating funds to support the local technology giants in the United States; in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, US and opened its chip OEM business.
When most people think Intel’s move will make certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and even steal their job.
They are sure about it because Intel, as an old tech giant in the US, worked diligently in the semiconductor industry for dozens of years and have a large amount of talent teams and technological reserve; it is bound to rise within a short time and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark and spoke bluntly about Intel’s move to build a wafer factory, “it is rather ironic for Intel to build an OEM factory of chips”.
Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel’s decision to get into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhong still holds a grudge against a feud between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the leading position in the world; it was a king in the semiconductor industry in the world.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been controlled by a few strong ones.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode; chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by the same factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.
To respond to the calling of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation of chips industry began to appear; in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s imagination became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was created.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aimed to set the single link of “processing of wafers” as its primary business; without design, only OEM services of wafer manufacturing was provided.
The newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was only a small player in front of Intel the giant.
In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but Intel was arrogant when it heard Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company only participated in the manufacturing of the chips industry; Intel looked down on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and resolutely refused to invest in it.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer manufacturing services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back in the days will also start to do wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to work on wafer foundry.
The market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has surpassed that of Intel.
Facing the powerful attack of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally dares not to stand still.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is trying to develop to the 3nm chips, and Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
It is actually not difficulty to surpass it.
I won’t wait any more.
It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06😅
Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.
What is normal public opinion?
Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.
They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together.

Omicron strain infection cases were found in Mauritius and other countries for the first time - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Beijing on December 12, reported by foreign corespondent of comprehensive Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported to have found the infection cases of Omicron strains, the new COVID-19 variant, for the first time.
Mauritius reported two infection cases of Omicron strains on December 10 for the first time.
According to introduction from Kelesh Jagutpal, Minister of Ministry of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected people was a tourist departing from South Africa and arriving in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius, who was tested positive in nucleic acid test on November 30 after contacting a person who returned from South Africa.
The nucleic acid test results of the two infected people changed to negative after quarantine and receiving treatment in the hospital, and now they have returned to their own respective residence.
It was announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that the country confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.
All of the 3 infected people were students who came back after traveling in other countries at the beginning of this month; all of them were not hospitalized because they were mild cases.
In order to prevent the spreading of the Omicron strains, the government of Cyprus kept strengthening the prevention and control.
All the passengers above 12 years old who enter the country by plane shall take nucleic acid test at their own expenses at the airport from December 6 to January 10 next year.
It was also announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that they would start inoculate children from 5 to 11 years old in the country with Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Kunbizze Chiponda, Minister of Ministry of Health of Malawi, said on December 9 that Malawi found 3 cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.
The Department of Health of Malawi conducted genomic sequencing for 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the 3 cases of infection.

I don’t think this act is helpful at all!
What I received is tripe.
The order is chicken feet.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in this conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain it.
Your delivery person told me the address is too far.
Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156
I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.
A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.
When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.
The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.
As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.
This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.
Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.
I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.
Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.
They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.
Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.
So please don’t choose such a swindler company.
When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.
If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly prohibited to publish any type of merchant review, and please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.
Dianping Kunming Renovation and Design Channel will provide you with the address, phone number, operation time and other information of Damei 360 Integrated Home Renovation, and please come to Dianping if you are looking for a renovation company.
It’s so horrible, and I will cancel the order if it doesn’t arrive in 30 minutes!
Is there really no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don’t cancel this conversation, and I’ll pursue it further if I don’t receive the refund in 5 to 10 days.
I asked if I could cancel it if it didn’t arrive in 15 minutes.
Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce is supposed to be fully cooked, but what I received is raw and inedible.
Rendezvous with the starry sky | Geminid meteor shower will usher in the maximum scale on December 14 - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Tianjin on December 12 (journalist: Zhou Runjian) According to introduction from astronomy science popularization expert, as the final large-scale meteor shower this year, the geminid meteor shower as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will be the maximum on December 14, and people who like meteor showers can observe during the latter half of the night on that day.
Photo of geminid meteor shower shot on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai by An Jiu, a lover of astronomy from Beijing.
The parent object of most of the meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the parent object of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 asteroid, which is also an Apollo type asteroid.
The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred” by comets so far.
According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the Council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science popularization, just like a new year blockbuster, geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “screening time” lasting from December 4 to December 17.
The geminid meteor shower is known for its ample flow and stabilization, which is called together with the Quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
A significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large number of fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photography.
This is the photo of geminid meteor shower shot on December 13, 2020 in Qinghai by Yang Jing, a lover of astronomy from Tianjin.
Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower this year will be reach its maximum scale at about 15:00 on December 14, and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is right above the head, and the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150.
Chart of index of recommendation level of the geminid meteor shower.
“Last year, people were impressed by the geminid meteor shower; however, the geminid meteor shower this year will be influenced by moon light, and its brilliance will be slightly influenced.
December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the moon in the gibbous phase; the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation; fortunately, the moon will go down in the latter half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher.
People who like meteor showers can observe it in the hours after moon goes down in the latter half of the night, but remember to stay warm.”
How to observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not advised to observe meteor showers in the city; you may choose a place facing northeast and has high altitude, a wide view and little light pollution, and then you may observe with your eyes after the moon goes down.
It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have heavy flows on all directions, and you do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower.
People who like photography can select wide angle lens and large aperture, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting if you want to take marvelous shots of the meteor shower.
Based on consideration of stability and sustainability, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are also necessary.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of the market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional TV which the original post mentioned is LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on big screen market.
Compared with the all-round market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of big screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TV is mainly from 55 to 65 inches, and the size of laser TV is usually over 75 inches, with bigger ones over 100 inches, which can satisfy the customers’ need for big screen TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of the global shipments and sales of laser TV keeps increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of CMM, the sales volume of laser TV market in 2020 will increase by over 140% and will continue to maintain a high-speed growth.
The reason for such great result in the big screen market is mainly the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection .
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eyeball; compared with the backlight of LCD TV, its imaging process is closer to that of objects under natural conditions, with less irritation to the eyes.
Ophthalmologists from CES Laboratory, China Electronics Standardization Institute, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
Statistics prove that laser TVs can indeed protect the eyes and may even make improvement in certain aspects.
As eye protection is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attracted more and more customers with the feature of eye protection, but also made another breakthrough in the market of color TVs.
Second, laser TV focuses more on high-end market.
Contrary to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, price of laser TVs on the market now is over 10,000 yuan, and it went up gradually with the upgrading of size and source of light.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have advantages that many LCD TVs and projectors don’t.
With the super short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment; it can realize the 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance; the space required is not large, and the small host takes up very little space.
In terms of lightness, laser TVs from famous brands can reach over 2,000 lumens.
Plus, the heat is lower, equipment loss is small, and the service life of TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with real 4K ultra HD image, artificial intelligent systems, bionic screens and other cutting-edge technologies, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.
Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, ultra wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, it uses an expensive microstructure Fresnel screen; the price of an 80-inch laser TV basically can be changed into a 65-inch LCD TV.
Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused “direct light”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen does not use diffuse reflection, imaging is not possible at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle being reflected into the eyes is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store has no branch store yet
I added their WeChat to make an appointment, then they sent me the available dates; their reply was speedy~
I went to the store to see the photography works, and there were more beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos and a lot of different styles.
After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.
However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to edit all the photos and I look forward to seeing them~
This is the second time that I have won the chance to experience a photoshoot for free~ you may choose one from most of the available outfits to do the photoshoot.
Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.
The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store reply
It is on the front page, come and see Queenie~
After I arrived at the store, I filled in my name and chose the outfits; all the wedding dresses were available to be chosen; I tried on three or four outfits and they were quite patient; after I decided on the dress, they were doing my makeup for a long time and they were also nice during this time; later in the shoot, they would teach you how to pose; I felt my face was too big on the photo; they said detailed editing would take a month, but they sent them to me after three to four days, and they seemed not that different from the original photos.
[Environment] It was not bad overall.
There are a lot of outfits to choose from.
There are about three seats for doing makeup and the studio is inside.
[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive to details.
The stylist was patient.
Photographer would patiently teach you to pose.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer would propose to take it again.
[Experience] Maybe the style was a little too much, double eyelids turned into triple eyelids.
The tail of my eyebrow got shaved, and it was a little awkward for those who don’t wear makeup normally.
The photos were sent to me after about ten days, but I was not very satisfied with the photoshop effect, and I feel that the double eyelids tapes are still obvious.
I tried on two outfits because I didn’t know what style to choose, and I ended up choosing the black suit after trying hesitating; the young lady said it was a vintage Audrey Hepburn style.
After choosing the outfit, we began with the hair and makeup; the hair stylist and makeup artist were super patient and I was really satisfied.
The photoshoot started after finishing makeup and hair, and the photographer guided me to pose the whole time; the process was relaxed and harmonious.
After the photoshoot, I chose my four favorite ones to be retouched, and the guy said the photos would be completed within 15 days and I was really satisfied with the results~
There has been no replies for three days, and as your system cannot identify my credit card, I can’t join the#PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee project!
What is strange is that I paid with the same credit card every time.
I have to pay the delivery fee every time now.
It can be exempted, and you can charge me with the monthly fee after the investigation, is that Okay?
Is it safe to buy insurance on Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the internet.
In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
In this regard, it is not bad and worth trusting.
In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, with star serious illness insurances of many companies on sale on this platform; for example, for the newly added HTLIC Super Mario 5 serious illness insurance, both the claim adjuster and the insurer are HTLIC, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only the third-party intermediary, whose reliability does not need to be questioned.
In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.
This is good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I worked as insurance telemarketing personnel in “Tencent Micro-Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you.
The insurance products on the internet are real and reliable, and it is the people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners on the internet, and there is much misleading information in sales.
For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they’ve been charged for one or two years.
They thought they could spend 1 yuan and get a six million claim settlement from the insurance company (pie in the sky).
Getting mobile phone for free means only policy ending with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888 can get a free phone, and no one will remind you again if the text message is sent to you and you don’t redeem it yourself.
(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
Our country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales at present.
Therefore, there is no problem with the platform or the products; what matters is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the original post should think about it carefully; in fact, there are many offline insurance brokerage companies with a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from; some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, helping each person save 2000-3000 yuan of premium per year.
If you have any question, feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker and have three years of experience in enterprise management training; I have served almost a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I will analyze the needs of my client and customize products for them; while insuring, I will compare all the insurance companies and help my client achieve the best underwriting result; after insuring, I will organize and hold the insurance policy to make my client feel at ease.
Grow with each client for a lifetime.
Hopefully my answer will help the original post!
According to the definition of insurance supervising departments, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insuring link.
In this process, neither the applicant nor the insurance consultant needs to sign, so all the steps can be fulfilled independently by the applicant.
Although insuring an Internet insurance product has no “sense of ritual”, and even there is no printed copy of contact, it doesn’t affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contract at all.
This pattern is somewhat similar to assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but buying insurance this way will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades; when we buy insurance, shouldn’t we seriously consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
Then how can I contact the food delivery person?
It’s almost three o’clock.
Then should you give me compensation?
I said to knock before handing me the delivery.
But the delivery person just left it at the door and left.
And got it wrong.
Your delivery person has picked up an order of mine at  #NUMBER#, but I was told I still needed to wait.
The delivery person picked up my takeout at 19:25, but still doesn’t want to set out.
I’ll go buy it, and do you need any other takeout?
What do I do?
Where is your delivery person?
Do I still need to wait?
I asked for the food to be delivered.
Okay, if you don’t cancel it, I’ll call the police.
But there will be safety and health issues in my food.

It will be okay after the discount code is reimbursed.
No problem, and remember not to arrange for a re-delivery, I have re-purchased it and I don’t want to cause any waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have been against any form of insult or abuse since the beginning, and I will not stand such personal attacks.
In this civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we need to get rid of these bullies.
If you don’t look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized actions that should be boycotted first.
I never replied to you since you started to send me Facebook friend request, published ridicule posts, and then tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father’s name on social media.
After that, you made it worse by not only continuing to tag me six times a day, but also continuing to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, figure, shape fit for giving birth, getting love bites in bed, whether to penetrate or not, I... forget it.
It was unexpected that more people sent me a photo uploaded to your Facebook friends page and your harassing comments.
Sorry, I cannot be silent anymore as a girl.
After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more arrogant.
I don’t care about your political background or your identity or position; in our society, the two genders shall respect each other.
Yes, you can continue with your ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you just care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to think that this is not harassment; you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yes, I can’t and won’t stop you.
I don’t know you and I don’t want to know you, and my appearance and body don’t need you judgement.
I don’t even think any girl would want to be famous by being humiliated like this.
My friends asked me if I was okay.
You won’t believe it if I say yes.
I don’t think any girl could say they are okay after being bullied like this.
No matter it’s in the workplace, society, politics or the business world, only those without basic moral character will harm a woman in this way.
I believe justice is in everyone’s heart.
I took screenshots of part of the comments and you can make your judgement.
You posted it yourself, and no one will pretend to be you, right?
I can only say you’re the enemy of civilization.

Home appliances in this store are quite complete, with many brands including almost all well-known brands.
During the Double 12 Sale, I went to the "Hunsdon" water purifier store to see the water purifiers, and there were sale activities in the store with favorable prices.
There are 11 floors in Easyhome, from B2 to 9th floor, in which B2 and B2 are for parking and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are really not nice, with few restaurants and hardware store, and the food there tasted average.
This elevator really makes people speechless; it went back and forth from B2 to B1 and did not stop on my floor, and it was ridiculous that when I went to the 1st floor from fire escape, it led to a furniture store which was closed, so I couldn’t get out from the fire escape, either!
Easyhome still needs to be improved with a lot of spaces to be developed.
Address: HSR North One Road, Bayishake District, convenient transportation, big parking lot free during the day.
Environment: Honestly, the store is large with 8-9 floors, where you can buy all the furniture, household appliances and small things your home needs, and many famous brands have settled in the store, such as DeRUCCI, OPPEIN, VATTI, Robam, Fengchuang Home, Hunsdon, Yake, AIA, Sealy, Fupinju, GUANGDONG MACRO, Nature, Zoomlion, Midea, Yadan, and so many other brands, I can only remember so many; it is a good place to buy products, and you can sit on the couch and have a rest if you get tired.
I recently want to buy a couch and my friend said there was a lot of couch to choose from here; I looked at Kuka Home and Markor Furnishings, and I felt they were okay but a little expensive, so I am still struggling to decide.
Dianping Urumqi Renovation and Design Channel will provide you with the address, phone number, operation time and other information of HSR Easyhome, and please come to Dianping if you are looking for a renovation company.

Full coverage of on-water green comprehensive service areas has been realized in the main stream of the Yangtze River - Xinhuanet
Message from Wuhan Xinhua News Agency on December 11 (Reporter: Wang Xian): Chongqing Fuling on-water green comprehensive service area was completed on schedule and put into operation on December 10, which was the 2nd on-water green comprehensive service area officially put into operation on the upper reaches of Yangtze River after the Sichuan Luzhou water green comprehensive service area started operation on December 8.
Up until now, on-water green comprehensive service areas have covered the upper reaches, the middle reaches and the lower reaches of Yangtze River.
According to introduction from Qiu Jianhua, deputy director general of Yangtze Navigation Administration Bureau of Ministry of Transport, before that, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu had constructed and put into use 10 on-water green comprehensive service areas in the middle reaches and the lower reaches of Yangtze River, which had been recognized by sailors and had played an important role in promoting high-quality development of shipping in the Yangtze River.
Full coverage of on-water green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event for the construction of green shipping of the Yangtze River, which has greatly improved the abilities of pollutant collection and shipping services of the Yangtze River.
As introduced, on-water green comprehensive service areas are important facilities that provide ships and sailors with comprehensive production and living services, and help them solve “emergent and difficult” problems.
The two newly established on-water green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with life services, production services and government services; with environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the features, they realize “multiple services at an anchoring” along the shore, providing sailors working in the Yangtze River all year long with more efficient work and more convenient life.
Three US aircraft carriers assemble around China; the most powerful weapons visit Guam in rare situation 2022-01-17 multidimensional Pro Communist media multidimensionally reports: latest news on China US Relation: the latest satellite image showed that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal in a rare case visited Guam, and sent an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to Chinese think-tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform”, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier from the US army near the Balabac Strait.
Connecting the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, the Balabac Strait is a strategic place on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that Carl Vinson will do deployment at the South China Sea.
This will be the first time that Carl Vinson carries F-35C fighter and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft to do the deployment.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carriers cruising in the Pacific Ocean now also include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
USS Abraham Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
Apart from the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently also deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser “Champlain Lake” and guided missile destroyer “Stockdale”.
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; on January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.
(Weibo @SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationDetection) three US aircraft carriers assembled around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationDetection) According to report of CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal paid a visit to Guam in a rare case.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; according to analysis, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China’s Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) the U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine “Nevada” to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrated the ability, flexibility, combat readiness of the US, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called “Boomer submarines”.
The whereabouts of the 14 “Boomer Submarines” in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes “Boomer Submarine" the “most important survival weapon in the Nuclear Trinity”; this system also includes launching silo ballistic missile located in the US, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I talked to my friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and its loss of US $251 billion in market value; Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”; why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising; the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel for traffic.
Regardless of its function positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all channels of traffic for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertisement alliance”; Many apps are externally connected to Meta’s advertising, and they achieve realization through Meta’s advertising platform.
But, the time has changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users’ data information now, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly; it will use explicit prompt to ask users whether they allow apps to access their own information; most people’s normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again next, it will have a greater impact on Meta’s revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta doesn’t have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
There are around hundreds of staff at its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas market, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and so most of the money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of ByteDance now is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to do advertising at Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven’t specifically learned about it recently, but it’s definitely not better than before.
The stage when Chinese companies were burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT is not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not the decline of revenue but lack of growth expectation.
The capital market not only focuses on income; more importantly, it depends on future expectations.
Obviously, the expectation for Meta is not enough.
In order to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg told the story about “Meta-universe”.
Meta-universe indeed should be one of the future directions, but the period of the realization of Meta-universe is long, and this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now with an annual income of US $100 billion to $200 billion; in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis; compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is not any good security moat.
Although the DAU of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp; however, in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion could happen in the blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of meta universe has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is in danger; this is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his choice is wrong and there is no way back; the above is some of my thoughts for reference.
