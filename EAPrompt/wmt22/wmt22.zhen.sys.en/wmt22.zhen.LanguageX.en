The research results of students playing the leading role at the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University make people's brains open-Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with breath, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with big brains were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical treatment, life science, humanities education, etc. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your family doctor
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, and this set of equipment can initially detect your health from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone, and after exhaling the air, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent operating lamp: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lamps are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"The early detection and removal of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lamps used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time during the early examination of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread later.
The intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels that enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent operating lamp has been tried out in run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the installed sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands! "
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful-first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think are important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of emergencies, that is, rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there motionless and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, according to our official data, three million people die accidentally every year, and the most dangerous one is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70 to 80% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, his breathing is gone, and his heartbeat is gone, there is no effect in pinching people.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save people.
I found that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid, but it is too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time in the face of emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There is still a discount for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be completed before the age of 25. It was a few months ago that the first aid certificate was added to the goal list, but it was indeed completed!
Then I have to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first aid certificate to take the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

First of all, in conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a bad film in all directions, in all senses.
But if you want to say that the film has no bright spots, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that makes you sleep soundly in the cinema, and the other that makes you indignant after watching it."Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really talented at insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a novel, which is indescribable and has many holes like a trench coat on Brother Ma.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The man should live on an island in the south, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
Old people ride vans from the south to the northeast to watch the snow?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man said nothing.
How did the hostess and his brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small bikers on the island easily close a mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feeling is too obvious.
Why did a small gangster biker party who failed to collect credit and was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why didn't you call the police? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot fills the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the film, or the film has no theme at all, it is an abominable stitch monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it halfway, you think it may be a plot film that wants to reflect that it is not easy for young people in a small town to survive. After watching it, you don't know what you saw at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy shit during the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational+comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie has achieved success step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should honestly talk about the grudge between the young people in the small town who like to ride motorcycles and the waitress sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't show anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role of a new motorcycle that has just been burned and can still sing), he can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't bear to see it.
As for the hostess who is obviously not mentally retarded but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Another thing I don't understand is why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots to his own movies?
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?

Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
Such as: all kinds of inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the module are concave and convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain.
The shear resistance of shaft wall is much better than that of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combined masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the transverse holes are intersected. After the hole core is poured, the cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The module is provided with reinforcement grooves vertically and horizontally, and the horizontal and longitudinal reinforcement correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking, water leakage and other phenomena. The shaft wall module has stable mechanical properties, simple operation and standard forming size.
The intelligent control of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, and the one-touch touch LCD display monitors the whole process of mechanical operation, realizing ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of shaft wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic and conveying, and double cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of the vibration of the main engine on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment distribution box goes up and down the mold box, the storage box door is closed, and the automatic conveying support plate is all completed independently by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, and hydraulic seals to ensure the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical excitation platform of shaft wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the table surface is wire-cut and molded without welding points, so that the stuffing box can swing freely and guide, and fully reduce mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the filler is combined with the two-in-one encryption amplitude, and the integration, full synchronization, platform vibration and mold vibration are adopted to ensure the vibration effect.
Shaft wall module mechanical excitation machinery, computer automatic control amplitude according to the cost performance of raw materials to adjust the amplitude, no wear braking, so as to prolong the service life and reduce costs.

Chongqing secondary vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship enrollment is the prospective employees of the enterprise-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who receive the pilot training also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprise employment procedures be standardized, and the dual identities of secondary vocational school students and enterprise prospective employees of apprentices be clarified. According to the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific posts, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentices on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt a modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training academic system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can take 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot modern apprenticeship in municipal secondary vocational schools in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot before implementation and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' post skills, and improve students' corresponding employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
With the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, and other flu-like symptoms, the Associated Press said.
Dr. UnbenPillay, director of the group, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized yet.
They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation, Pillay said."
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness due to coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, the COVID-19 patients he treated in the last wave of Delta had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of outbreaks; the average length of stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared with 20% of early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as saying: "at present, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It is still early and we need to get late data.
Usually, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we are only two weeks into this wave of outbreaks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of COVID-19, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
Gauteng province saw a 400% increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, according to health officials, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan of "no sale, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "abduction", mass prevention and control, and anti-abduction by the whole people make abduction unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not happen frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and find abducted children in a timely manner.
Hearing that this App is called "Reunion", I feel warm.
The new technical means are not only named "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also the information technology is used properly, practically and effective.
The primary goal of anti-abduction law enforcement is to find abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", controversial topics such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be subject to the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed carefully; but the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction search is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step away from the parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with effective methods such as the "reunion" platform, which directly help to solve cases and find children.
After all, "anti-abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To crack down on crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice and the meticulous law enforcement, we all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three resting at the railway station, their parents slept soundly and woke up to find that their child was gone.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the legal starting point for the crime of abducting and trafficking in children is 5 years; if the circumstances are especially serious, they may be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of abducting and trafficking in children obviously belongs to the crime of heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising children.
The legal education of these people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" of abduction exists widely, the traffickers are greedy for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, and form a situation of "fighting law" with law enforcers, the anti-abduction action is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward concepts and popularizing legal common sense will also help to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress in Malanshan
Draw strength from the party's century-old struggle history

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin OliveOil) and refined olive oil (Virgam OliveOil or Refined OliveOil), with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is an oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtering.
It can be divided into three levels according to the acidity:
Extra Virgin olive oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with light and pleasant plant aroma and acidity of no more than 1%.
Quality virgin olive oil (FineVirgin): slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (OrdinaryVirgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained from refined virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or become "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile taste and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is transparent light golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or olive fruit residue oil (RefinedOlive-PomaceOil): olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution method and refined.
If you have seen the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruits are like grapes that make wine. Olive fruits from different producing areas and different olive fruit varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for olive growth.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on. Similar to its climate are Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on as far away as the southern latitude.
Olive picking month:
From March to June every year, it is the time for olive trees to blossom and set fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, and the fruits transition from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
Democracy summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and administrative councilor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of autocracy, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public good."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, spoke to the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
During a roundtable discussion on "Combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values", Tang Feng, an administrative councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, released a national statement by video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retrogression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take it off the shelves to defeat false information."
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which were found to have seriously violated human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish it, then the expensive normal situation will be friendlier than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry beat" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't hold it, and it is difficult for the master to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn it, and I know you don't want to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so this racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. When that time, come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, and choose prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't sell the price. A new racket of 500 or 600 is very good. A second-hand racket of 200 yuan, is it not fragrant to have a thousand yuan racket?
It's very friendly to novices, but it's chicken ribs after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times
Can you help follow up?
Postponed
Thank you
That is to say, I already have credit?
Do I need to reorder next? Don't pay attention to the original order?

In fact, there is a lot of attention to the dressing and matching of girls who are slightly fat.
The skirt worn by a fat girl should not be too short or too long, the length is almost at the knees, just enough to cover the fat thigh.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be revealed.
Too long will give people the feeling of short and fat.
If you wear it out and separate the upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you are naturally taller, that is, the upper body, skirt and stockings will look like a slender feeling with different colors.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for slightly fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to cover up your fat body. Noble and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for slightly fat girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially short black skirts, will make people think you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeable.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Lest people feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For slightly fat girls, you must tell the trick of dressing and matching.
Fat girls should never wear tight short skirts. In addition, the coat should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or grid socks (the kind of fine plaid). Choose a soft printed flared skirt and match a swing shirt to cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts, and they should choose a coat with the same color as the short skirt, which will make your fat body have the effect of increasing height.
Short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a MM with fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
It can not only cover your belly, but also show your advantages.
A-shaped short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, the coat should be tight, the formation of a sense of hierarchy will be thinner.
Simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the change in dressing and matching, we should also exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of slightly fat girls one day earlier <unk>

The girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think of a flesh injury"-Xinhuanet
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
The behavior caused a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity person in charge of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an excessive move only after collecting money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street "target" fundraising warned
In the online picture, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow" written in black ink. Another wooden board in front of her has her bank account number and Wechat, Alipay account number and so on.
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this is an "eye-catching begging behavior", and many netizens express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square at about 10 am on the 23 rd, and there were already a lot of onlookers at that time."
The police of Tianshui police station near the incident said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who set up the stall, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed up in youthful and beautiful clothes.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; another girl helped shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity person in charge of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for shooting, but they did not participate in it. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but someone was watching and took photos and sent them to Weibo.
Later, the police were identified by the public security department that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eye-catching fundraising method is not advocated."
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest in 2021 ?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic events that project managers can impact gold medals" is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and it is not a problem to put out fires, carry the pot and apologize.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability of the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management gradually choose to get rid of the difficulties in their work through some actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the China Project Management 20-year Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP Â® applicants in the country was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP Â® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP Â® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past "old experience". The rapidly changing working environment makes us know that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and I don't know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and project procrastination; The division of labor among members is not clear, the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to deal with the cross-departmental assistance and communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to promote ...
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R & D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises train a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "Chinese Enterprise R & D Management Talent training demonstration Base", came with the online course "R & D Project Manager Special training Camp".
The online course "Special training Camp for R & D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
You can first see what other students think of this course: this course is not only a professional explanation of the course content by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

(hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; According to the debt Status Report of Chinese Young people released by Nielsen and the 2019-2020 China Youth consumption report released by CCTV Finance, the younger generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption.86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation shows a rational consumption trend as a whole, although it is quite different from the label of "excessive profligacy" affixed to the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even lead to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the regulatory call to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
In the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and through cooperation with domestic top universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms of imperceptible guidance to the consumption needs of young people, help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption demand, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on economic life such as buying a car and house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be selected, and attention should be paid to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more in-line and diversified services, continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and be a reliable consumer financial partner for consumers for life.

Vietnam People's Daily Network-Gulf Cooperation Council meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, which is based on the demand that they must unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, and aims to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers on salvaging the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal condemned by the Gulf Arab states for not being able to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran against the background that nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failed to meet the aspirations of Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first among GCC countries since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the exhaust sound of supercar in Xinshan District is the loudest !
This car brought by our team is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar and Murcielago's replacement-AventadorLP700-4 !
The asking price is nearly RM2 million, the road tax is RM10,000 a year, and the four-wheel drive is called LP700 ?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, the editor doesn't know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds for 0-100 km/h to accelerate, which is probably when the editor's myvi reaches 30 km/h, people will reach 100 km/h, um.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 v 12 engine under the glass perfectly explain Lamborghini's style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it yourself, and the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not be able to give!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (actually a little cool)
The fuel cost of 1 km is about RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, or it will be a little awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf immediately after getting off the bus. (But it's still cool)
The body is too big, parking in an ordinary parking space will be very narrow, and I am afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (what the editor said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!
For more information about cars you don't know, it's in The CarGuide/People's Automobile Journal.
When it comes to a car accident worth tens of millions!
BugattiChiron and Porsche 911 believe that riders know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Look at the results, it makes sense to be expensive!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running ideas and value pursuits accumulated by a university for a long time in the process of development, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is very important to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they rise in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "helping the world by virtue and governing peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "invigorating learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology and talents is intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "the overall plan to promote the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines" not only shows China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time, speed up the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve "corner overtaking"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of backwardness, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school-running quality; Second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past 5,000 years, carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands and enhance image; Third, institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university on the one hand, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running a school: first, we should highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated education environment with the integration of science and education and the combination of schools and enterprises, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Third, highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the industry-university-research cooperation system of Pan-Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, moral cultivation, discernment and truthfulness" and "Haina River, enlightenment of truth and virtue, opening things up to the people and building our country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "talents from all over the world for my use", and absorbs the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people from world-renowned schools; "Kai Zhen Hou de" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality while pursuing truth; "opening things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also reform and development and innovation; "Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share prosperity and disgrace with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
The wise listen to silence, and the wise see in the invisible.
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit stir up with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At the time when NFT was rushing out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called AxieInfinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in the game.
"AxieInfinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of games including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction value, and has exceeded $3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that AxieInfinity has a daily revenue of more than $8.2 million, which is close to "Arena of Valor".
On August 6 this year, AxieInfinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "AxieInfinity" has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contract, players are no longer a single role. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I see a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First of all, we must choose an industry with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan. Secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future, and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market size, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is "do the things right", that is, do things right.
The strategy lies in "dotherightthing", that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, and tactics lies in landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On the basis of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new ones; On the basis of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, which is the first time bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares to launch a bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment at three Ivy League schools including Yale-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23 rd, protesting that three Ivy League schools-Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College-discriminate against Asian applicants in the enrollment process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American schools has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in the three famous American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that research by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that of all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment.
They also expect the complained colleges and universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their enrollment policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in enrollment at Harvard University, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the applicants also include Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a housing agent. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family member of the house owner, on the details of the purchase of the factory, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "receipt of deposit for the sale of factory building", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agreed to sign the plant sales contract within one week."
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sale and payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It was not easy to take a fancy to the house, the deposit was paid, and the house payment was ready, so I was "close to the door" to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not only be attributed to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability for breach of contract by double return of the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[lawyer reminder] the necessary duty of care should be performed in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary duty of careful care, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a speech on Saturday (December 11) that the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" held by the United States is "to draw an ideological line, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, act against democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatist confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', resulting in disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting, which was held by video, was attended by leaders of 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, such as criticizing some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration was not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
"Today's American democracy is morbid, with money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial contradictions, polarization between the rich and the poor intensifying", and American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of autocracy, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted."We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuous and worrying challenges."
The United States has pledged to launch a year-long campaign after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let all our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
OK, I'm afraid he sent it to the wrong address

What is the way to drink red card whisky?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red card whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and red card whisky has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of red card whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you will spoil its mellow aroma.
So how do you drink red card whisky?
Xiaobian gives you a brief introduction.
Red card whisky:
Johnnie Walker Red Card whisky is a blend of about 35 kinds of Scotch whisky. It has the characteristics of strong aroma and traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is mellow and fresh, with a touch of vanilla and strong smoked malt.
The wine can be drunk directly on ice or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red card whisky has entered China. In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, red card whisky+cola or Sprite or Sunkis and other sparkling drinks have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also bring pleasure to people visually. Adding drinks can dilute the taste of wine and change the taste.
Red card whisky+sliced lemon+sugar cube (granulated sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
Authentic Red Fangwei tastes a little sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, while lemon will bring fresh fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal tastes and hobbies.
The above three are the best ways to drink red card whisky. You can try them as a reference. I hope the introduction of Xiaobian can help you.
Educational thinking: how to make "high achiever" and "low achiever" get their own place in university exams-Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, college examinations have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, combined with different levels of learning, the learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may pass the exam by concentrating on assault before the exam. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be a "strange status quo" that "learning dregs" can pass the level without investment, and even get high marks; "learning tyrants" never miss classes, their homework and notes are all good, and their exams are not much higher.
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in the university examination are not without reason, and I believe this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam by surprise, think of various ways to "take" exam questions from teachers, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and get "key tutoring" before the exam. It is not uncommon to even carry cheat notes in the exam and ask the teacher to raise your hand after the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a guidance of teaching quality evaluation, to measure whether a university examination is qualified or not lies in teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of the discipline. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "I learned the basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago, but I am still learning it, which is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will form the examination paper as a whole, and the examination marking will also be participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, in order to draw up a set of examination questions that are in line with the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty is normally distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and the type of questions, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and carry out innovative design of the type of questions at the same time.
Examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination there is, students will have corresponding preparation programs, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the students' suggestion letter and has deployed a rectification plan in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course closing exams, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and examination links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problems of single type of examination questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an issue that university examination services need to face. Of course, it is necessary to introduce corresponding systems, but kung fu is expensive in daily life, which requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to thoroughly understand the students' learning situation, so that teaching and learning will be better connected and form a positive interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "high achiever" and "low achiever" can get their own way.
If you can't change the location of the branch for me, can you change it to delivery?
Then I don't have to pay more, do I?
My colleague's order has been delivered
Can't finish it
What about GPS? Have you arrived
Mrs. Kim Wedding Photography (South Street Store) has no branch yet
Before taking the photo, because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lan Lan patiently arranged the time for us.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather.
Mrs. King's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are excellent.
It was the first time in my life that I made up formally. Wow ~ I can't believe I will look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient with makeup and natural with makeup.
The location was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day and I didn't feel very cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and immediately helped us arrange them if there was a little bad.
The photographer is also very humorous and feels very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn't want customers to delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, we didn't mean to add photos at all. I didn't add any of the 24 photos in the direct package (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to more than 7,000 packages. I was shocked at that time, and I was afraid that I would choose too many)
Today, the photos were repaired, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them and felt that they were not very good. They immediately repaired them for me.
Comparing the photos taken by my sister before, I think I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos with Mrs. Xuanhan Jin!
Set price:3999 yuan
Mrs. Kim is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3, 200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11 th) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper has been used up, it has not been able to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200 so far.
However, Kailu Aminus, director of the bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for birth registration paper have been recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained a report by an online media that the printing problem of raw paper in Sabah had occurred for 10 months.
He said that the problem emerged two months ago, and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, which has delayed delivery to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah paper is different from that in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will inform applicants to go to local branches to collect birth registration paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth papers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock to now
Is that coming soon?
I mean the food
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG #
OK, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone", the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document requesting to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in port cities, requiring personnel who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours and go to land border port cities to conduct at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions can study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border residents of both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of regional differentiated management policies, from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local clustered epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
According to the above notice, this has exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, inadequate disinfection of cold chain goods in all links, non-standard management of centralized isolation places, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The circular requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the filling of the weaknesses in prevention and control in port cities, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, science and precision, and weave and tighten the external defense input defense line.
The circular stressed that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work at the same time, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts and flags) where the open land, waterway and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, prefectures and leagues) and the municipalities directly under the Central Government where they are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

The truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the US military for 20 years-Xinhuanet
(video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a microdocumentary called "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Abuse of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black prison" to inflict all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have aroused hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American "war on terror" is "more and more anti-terrorist".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article and talked about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help make canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then you will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between tin and bag so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of the cans is just different!
Now let me tell you the reason why cans are expensive. Where is it expensive?
Their raw materials are the same. Why is the price difference so large?
Because when pricing, most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote cans instead of bags.
And you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion expenses of the market, such as the promotion personnel of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and their prices are also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, unscrupulously linked with doctors in hospitals, who assist in the promotion of products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a listen.
And China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans on the premise of having cans at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no effect on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned bags is longer than that of bagged bags. If the shelf life of canned bags is the same as that of bagged bags after opening the bags, it is just that it is not easy to store and is easy to deteriorate due to moisture.

Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" before telling you what you need to do.
It means that we have suddenly passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Because of this, these books all have one thing in common-either do your best in one go, or do nothing at all; it's either 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will make anyone admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "change", stagnant, and difficult to make up their minds; or with a temporary impulse, they have made a painful determination to "change" and bravely took the first step, but often the good times do not last long, and they will not be defeated for a long time, so it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people and makes most people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold"-it encourages a theory of "accumulating small wins into big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because it's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than nothing.
As the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, it can actually motivate a few in the end; while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 7,100 tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960 s and 1970 s, affected by a large number of human hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers entering Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continuously strengthen protection, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially multiplied and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the three rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued a ban on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and established a comprehensive ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

I just saw an article about my period. It's too long.
Give popular science to men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, I will come regularly once a month on the premise of good health.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the car will overturn due to bad luck (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people spend three days and some people have a week; Some people flow less, some people collapse; Some people don't respond, some people feel pain until the ambulance is transported away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, before no pain does not mean a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, and bleeding 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end. All you can do is suck blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen before dysmenorrhea at the beginning of the physiological period can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the physiological period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins.
If it is about to reach the cycle and have inexplicable diarrhea, you will basically have menstruation within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Apart from sleep time, the worst case is to change them six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 tablets. If you add the prepared portion in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(Modify it here, tampons do not need to be changed frequently, they can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormones may be more irritable, and ovulation will also be emotionally unstable because of hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will stumble on itself.
But official crime figures show that women still have a high ability to control their emotions, and they don't use emotional problems as an excuse.
It's not just blood, it includes the exfoliated endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, the house is built (the endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, all of them are removed (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built next month, over and over again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a few days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants to?
But a person can be born because his mother has menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for her regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, and that the preparation of women's bodies for life is disgusting, they should not say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think so again. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can this attitude be embarrassing to face their mother and how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons. They really work.
Today is the winter solstice festival, it is disappointing to send it wrong
Want to order another meal for the children
I hope the store will check the products during its busy schedule
Is the foot bath foot numb leaking?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot baths are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. Foot baths ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan are dazzling, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain potential safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt numb on the soles of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt the soles of his feet numb.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was not bad. Although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that the foot bath, which has been popular for a long time, now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, there will be no electrification problem in the foot bath, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when they leave the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath when buying.
Water and electricity are separated without any potential safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to test at will.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo-Viewpoint headline-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held in Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to show the tea industry, innovate tea technology, carry forward tea culture, and accelerate the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly recommended at the opening ceremony: the source of lake red is being innovated, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunan, four rivers and colorful tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea such as green tea, black tea and black tea have taken turns to make efforts. The main tea producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism and driven the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The feng shui turns in turn, and the black tea works again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has soared.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua welcomed the "Source of Lake Red".
In Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the perspective of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, which has injected the connotation of tea culture, is popular and popular, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up because there was no parking below
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is called the way, and the metaphysical is called the weapon", which is translated by metaphysics for Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is to "study which nouns represent real existence entities and which nouns only represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the study of God without a word.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a subject of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging different moral values and giving moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior.
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to real life conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral subject (mL/agent), which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice, and it studies the ethics held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
The third part: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli et al., modern ethics (17 th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume et al., 17 th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire et al., 18 th-19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant and Hegel, 18 th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham and Sikiwick, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer and Huxley, etc., late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier, etc., late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kier@@
Logic is a subject that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject with the theme of the study of the essence and significance of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families and employed.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped us families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to our mother group, Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the National Aesthetics Association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often cross.

It is often difficult for relief money to be delivered smoothly to June 4 th.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, the "Tiananmen Mother" set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphan elderly special poverty relief fund", which has been implemented ever since.
These projects are mainly funded by campus and social donations in June 4 th, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of June 4th finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4th that year.
During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped donating on June 4th for the consideration of donors. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect our decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous and courageous colleagues who have been generous and risked delivering humanitarian aid money for many years.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, you'd better study by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose self-study, but you will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, the teachers of some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but the first learning cost is high, the second investment time is more, basically need centralized training for 3-6 months.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources to go to bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for study, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that the study does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explains in detail, and there are special answers to questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal recommended places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the later job interview can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views. Because I don't know your situation, I only introduce it in general and in detail. If you have other things you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, and I saw it all in the App

When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and when I have it, I am happy; when I grow up, happiness is a goal, and when I achieve it, I am happy; when I mature, I find that happiness is originally a state of mind, and when I understand it, I am happy.
Be the truest and kindest of yourself, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, go your own way; Two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful life is too old!
At every stage of life, we will encounter different problems.
In many cases, it is not your ability that binds you, but your courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face the difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators join hands to hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th in the JAX Art District of Diriyah, northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheriting as an Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "on the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performing arts. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted much attention, and some artists use recycled materials to create in novel ways. For example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in "Endless Pictures of streams and Mountains in the Story Series" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Dirier Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale will establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community and strengthen interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, not only to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and artists, curators and opinion leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize rural public welfare post management-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment assistance to people out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help promote rural revitalization in an all-round way.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts for the employment of rural poor groups such as poverty reduction labor force, and plays an important role in helping people out of poverty to increase employment income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly standardize the target scope, fund management, post development, and post management of rural public welfare posts recruited at the grass-roots level.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations make it clear that it will be set up in accordance with the principles of "setting up posts on demand, appointing people by posts, dynamic management, total amount control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary openness and unified management".
The recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, examination, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement of posts.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that all rural public welfare post development departments should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare post resettlement personnel; relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

Second, although the Rightists have had successful times in history, they are not long, so they are short because they give a little sunshine and sweat when they drink a little boiled water; if they have a little ambition, they will be able to look at Shu, and if they are hit, they will be attached.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied from the aspects of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I care about his remarks and respect Li Weidong very much, because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to take chestnuts from the fire by political speculation are not rightists, but assholes.
Let's talk about left again.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left will not have this nature, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the left madness while fighting against the thieves, and they were really angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left epilepsy. They are all the same tendons and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you for five cents, and when the left madness scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even the dragon slayer youth eventually became a dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes from history and culture should lead China as a whole to the left.
The domestic rightists are free and pay attention to efficiency and development, while the leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and security.
At present, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States will struggle to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'll be finished if I like it
Don't say anything. Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists not only put Huawei in unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The US imperialism cracked down on China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the impact on the orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in a reduction in R & D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", technology giants in more and more countries began to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions to host the "Chip Summit"; It also invited the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and allocated funds to support the local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why it is so sure is that Intel, as an old technology giant of the United States, has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, which is bound to rise rapidly in a short period of time and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, shrugged off Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a shocking remark. Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples about Intel's move to invest in building a fab: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still has a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960 s and 1970 s, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, ranking at the top of the world and the overlord of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980 s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM mode, and the chip design, manufacturing and packaging and testing were completed by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980 s, the chip industry began to have the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in chip design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing". It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a minion in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it obviously thought highly of itself, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I didn't expect that the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services at that time would now start to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3 nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14 nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Don't wait

Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of the second dragon in February, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Lala incident. The spread of public opinion formed a peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] displayed on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
[solitary peak] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search list, attracting public attention; [zigzag] is periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [cliff] is collective evacuation, the hot search has played its "function", received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that the unified batch of water forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war and create momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, and which entangle decision-making, and the black industry accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Aside from all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every walk will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

Mauritius and other countries found the first case of Omicron virus infection-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12-Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first case of COVID-19 mutant virus Omicron strain infection.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron virus infection for the first time on the 10 th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected person, a local resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who returned from a recent trip to South Africa.
After isolation and treatment in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron virus infection have been confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized because they were all mild.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country against Pfizer COVID-19.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbeze Chiponda said on the 9th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were found in the country for the first time.
The country's health department carried out genome sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home improvement
Address:12th floor, Happy Home, 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at my initial budget of 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
When I came to the store, I started a series of tricks.
It was my first time to go to the store and just showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the field to measure the house. They could actually give me a quotation saying that 70,000 of my 135 house could be done. I probably showed me their materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that as soon as you arrive at the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you will never return it unless you have enough experience to fight theory with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When my mind was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 deposit.
There are many problems with the price he quoted me.70,000 does not include water and electricity transformation, does not include any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at first.
When I went to them for a refund, they showed a lot of experience and had a small team to deal with you.
It's the customer's problem that they will bite to death in one bite anyway, and they are totally irresponsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities, there are many details, don't want to say them one by one are tears, in short, don't choose them, because the quality of the house my friend asked them to decorate is also not good, and I will calculate various expenses for you later.
Pit dad, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, but now they are changed into Damei, as if they have closed down and changed into other ones.
So don't choose such a stupid decoration company.
In the future, when you choose Baidu, take a look at these and check these consultations because decoration is not a small sum of money.

Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money in 5 to 10 days, you must pursue it.
I asked if I could cancel in less than 15 minutes

The Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great deal on the 14 th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast an Jiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid Phaeton 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by comets.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like the New Year's blockbuster, Geminid meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow. Together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A significant feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that meteors are slow, colorful and have many fire meteors, which is suitable for both visual and beginners of astronomical photography.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing takes a Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) of 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, people were deeply impressed by the colorful Geminid meteor shower, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, which will be a little less exciting.
The 14th is November 11th of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a full and convex moon. Bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, when the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the last few hours after the moon, but pay attention to cold and warm protection."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light damage and a wide field of vision facing the northeast in the suburbs or rural areas, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to stare at the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower all the time during observation.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a gorgeous' meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, a tripod, spare battery and shutter cable are also essential."
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the theme should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV obviously focuses more on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, laser TV shipments and sales in the world have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why there are such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also less.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative experiments of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirm that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in the price of LCD TV, the current price of laser TVs on the market is mostly more than 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and occupies a small space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the calorific value is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system and bionic screen, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
There is no false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing it, you can judge for yourself, and you are afraid to listen to one side of the story.
To put it simply, laser TV, an ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the curtain, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructure Fresnel curtains is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be changed into a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection as a selling point for their eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that your eyes can see is direct light to your eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. If you have to be serious, LCD TV is also diffuse "direct". Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot be imaged at all.
It is just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenzhao Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store has no branch for the time being
After adding the appointment date of Wechat, the little sister sent me the optional time arrangement, and the reply information was more timely ~
Before going to the store, I saw the shooting works, more of which were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my ideas with my little sister, patiently helped me try two sets of clothes in my tangled style, and finally decided to start makeup modeling. The photographer will put some props before shooting, guide the actions, and strive for perfection in every detail.
But maybe because I didn't exchange specific shooting ideas with me, what I shot was not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking <unk> <unk>
After shooting, the photographer will help select the photos and exchange the later style. I feel very careful.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, wait for the effect ~
For the second time, I won the overlord meal activity of photo class ~ most of the clothes in the audience can choose one to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup+shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting is the younger brother of the post-95 generation. I feel a little green. I hope I can give more suggestions on the guidance of customers' shooting actions in the future. ~ It's very talkative and the shooting process is more pleasant.

On the homepage, let's take a look at Queenie ~
When you go to the store, fill in your name and phone number and then choose your clothes. You can choose your wedding dress. It is quite patient to change three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, you have made up for a long time, and your service attitude is good. The later shooting will teach you how to pose, that is, the face is so big. It takes half a month to refine and it will be sent in three or four days. It feels like it is no different from the original film.
[Environment] overall good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and inside is the studio.
[Service] very warm and careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to make up the shot.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a little too much. The original double eyelids were pasted with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrow has also been shaved, which is a little embarrassing for those who do not thrush.
The photos have been given for more than ten days, but the effect of the P picture is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelids are still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets and chose a black dress. The little sister said that this set was more Hepburn retro
After choosing the clothes, I began to make up my hair, and the hairdresser and makeup artist were super patient and helped me get the effect very satisfactory
After finishing my makeup and hair, I began to take pictures. The photographer directed me to pose all the time. The process was very easy and harmonious
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite pictures when the finishing brother said that the ending of the film within 15 years was very satisfied ~
There has been no reply for 3 days... Because your system does not recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay the freight every time now
You can waive it first and charge my monthly fee after your investigation. Is that OK?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before it can be established, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
These three articles are actually very harsh. To sum up, we must have strength, approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), and shareholders should have a good style. As the small umbrella insurance of insurance brokerage companies, policyholders do not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which cannot be achieved by any insurance company.
At this point, it is not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance. The claimant and underwriter are both Hetai Life Insurance. Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of policyholders, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can insure by themselves. There will be many misunderstandings. In health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it, so it is easy to have many hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being refused compensation.
I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true and reliable. People are unreliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example:1 yuan insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, get 60,000 serious illness insurance for free, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important points and will not tell the insured that 1 yuan in the first month and the next month need to be charged according to normal charges, ranging from dozens to 200. It is not clear what many customers bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company paid 6 million yuan (the world lost the pie).
Free mobile phone delivery is only delivered by the special policy number segment such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not exchange it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the policyholder) It is short-term to get 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, what can 60,000 do? It can't solve the problem, and your life will start to run naked in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform and the products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should be considered carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I have helped 59 Internet customers myself to underwrite offline products, and each person can save 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, who has 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from customer needs and tailor insurance products for customers. During the insurance, I will shop around for customers and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy arrangement and policy trusteeship for customers, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "sense of ceremony" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
So how can I get in touch with the delivery specialist
It's almost 3 o'clock
Is that going to give me compensation
I said knock on the door to deliver
But the rider was left at the door, and then the man left
Also send the wrong
Your rider has picked up a takeout from me at #NUMBER#, but still tells me to wait
The rider received my takeout at 19:25, but still refused to leave
I'll buy it. Do you want any other takeout?
What to do
Where did your rider go
Have to wait?
I want to send the bill
OK, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police
But there will be safety and hygiene problems in my food

No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange redelivery, I have purchased it separately, and I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help
From before to now, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we just want to put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that we must resist first.
Since you started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting ironic posts, and then you tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to unscrupulously discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as appearance, figure, good fertility, what kind of strawberries to grow in bed, whether to insert or not, I... Forget it.
How did I know that later I received comments from many friends about uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment on your Facebook friend account?
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you didn't converge at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and no matter what your status is, in our society, we need respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridicule, obscure, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you just love and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think any girl would want to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut off some messages for everyone to comment on
No one can pretend to be you in your own post
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization
A knowing smile
Vietnamese People's Daily Network-Vietnamese Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major meetings were held during the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, and the discussion topics focused on two major themes: digital technology enterprises and the country's digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 epidemic.
Nguyen Mengxiong, Minister of Communications and Media, said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number and operating income of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam continued to grow by nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam cultivated the number of typical digital products, focusing on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Nguyen Meng-hsiung called on digital technology enterprises to take the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to assume the national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are researching, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared breakthrough ideas and solutions to mobilize and pool the resources of the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promote the country's digital transformation, and Zhu Hui's economic recovery after the epidemic.
In his speech at the forum, Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation is the only way for the world and the objective demand of development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem, and digital transformation serves the whole people, so it is necessary to mobilize the whole people to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, subject, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for people and enterprises.
Premier Fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, with internal forces as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as important and breakthrough points.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and help green transformation and development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the establishment of databases to protect and carry forward national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, etc., and promote digital transformation in banking, taxation, land management and development databases, as well as logistics and other fields.

The main stream of the Yangtze River realizes full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10 th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8 th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that before that, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were recognized by the majority of crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River, and the capacity of ships in the Yangtze River to receive pollutants and shipping services has been significantly improved.
According to reports, the water green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for the majority of ships and crew members, and to help the majority of crew members solve the problem of "urgent difficulties and worries".
The two water green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which are completed and operated this time, integrate life services, production services and government services, take green environmental protection as the theme, and feature ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services. The realization of "one berthing and multiple services" for ships in the port will make the work of the crew sailing in the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional reports: the latest news on Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was discovered by satellite near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the Western Pacific Ocean.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carrier currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean also has the USS AbrahamLincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USSRonaldReagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided missile destroyer "Stockdahl".
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USSNevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
A rare visit to Guam by the three US aircraft carriers to gather the most powerful weapons around China said it was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980 s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomersubmarines".
The whereabouts of 14"Thunder submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually closely guarded.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make Thunder submarines "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity". This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located in the United States, as well as bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads, such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the evaporation of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's ads, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users' data and information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened before (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies that do offshore business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta can make a lot of money from bytes in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
I haven't learned about it recently, but it will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale is over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "meta-universe".
Meta universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of meta universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very beautiful now, it also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although several of his social software have relatively high daily life and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is just a blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of meta-universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
