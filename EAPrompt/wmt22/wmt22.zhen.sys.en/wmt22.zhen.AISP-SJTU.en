At the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, the research results of students playing the leading role make people's brains open-Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases with breath, and accurately search for the source of smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with wide brain holes were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: Your family medical examiner
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, and this instrument can initially detect your health from the gas composition you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that this sensor is connected to the smart phone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling air.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen sense of smell enables it to reflect the health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent operating lamp: doctors' high-energy eyes
Besides smart phones, smart operating lamps are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver prize at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented intelligent LED shadowless lamps for surgery.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time during the early examination of cancer, the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent operating lamp has four lamp panels, which can enhance the difference between different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of light spots at any time according to the needs of operation and personal habits.
This intelligent operating lamp has been tried in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and be cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most, wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the installed sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! "
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to be driven by our own gravity, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that feels very meaningful-first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think are important besides my driver's license!
Popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when emergencies occur, that is, rescue before ambulances come.
As we all know, there is still a period of time when the ambulance comes after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage and respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone falls around us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there silly and doing nothing. This helpless feeling is terrible.
"In China, according to our official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, 70% to 80% can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing. "
This is what Lu Le, founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, his breath is gone, and his heartbeat is gone, it is useless for you to pinch people.
Artificial respiration must be done, and chest compressions can save people.
I found that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid, but it is too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The first aid card can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There is also a discount for students.
PS: The last picture records the goals to be completed before the age of 25. It was a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the goal list, but it was really completed!
Then I have to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw another diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first aid certificate before I can take the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

First of all, I personally think "Four Seas" is a bad film in all directions, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether the film has no bright spots, it is not at least that the soundtrack is well chosen.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that makes you sleep soundly in the cinema, and the other that makes you indignant after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a novel, which is indescribable and flawed like a trench coat on Mark.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The man's residence should be on an island in the south, living alone with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a big uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minibus.
Old people watch snow from south to northeast in vans? ?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man has no following.
How did the hostess get the business license when he opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can wild one punks on the island easily close a mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This sense of props is too obvious.
Why did wild one, a punk who failed to collect credit and was suspected of breaking the law, become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why didn't you call the police? In the movie, the police specially asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but he doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot fills the whole film, because the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the film, or the film has no theme at all, that is, an abominable sewing monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it halfway, you think it may be a feature film that wants to show that it is difficult for young people in small towns to survive. After watching it, you don't know what you saw at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy shit in the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie succeeds step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, you should honestly talk about the feud between the young people who like to ride motorcycles and the waiter's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't show anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Andrew's new motorcycle has just been burned, and then he can sing), so he can't open some brain holes that Kennedy can't stand watching.
As for the hostess who is obviously not retarded but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Another point I don't understand is why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots to his own movies.
Is this kind of movie arranged in the Spring Festival file to add to the audience?

Inspection Well Concrete Module Production and Processing Equipment Characteristics and Advantages of Zhengzhou Shaft Lining Brick Module Equipment;
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used as a new masonry material for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
Such as: all kinds of inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are concave-convex groove structures, which are combined to form chain locks.
The shear resistance of shaft wall is far better than that of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After combined masonry, the longitudinal holes communicate with each other and the transverse holes intersect. After the hole core is poured, the cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The module is provided with reinforcing grooves vertically and horizontally, and the transverse horizontal reinforcing bars and longitudinal reinforcing bars correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built by concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, sinking and water leakage, and the shaft wall modules have stable mechanical properties, simple operation and standard forming dimensions.
Intelligent control of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, and one-push-to-talk touch liquid crystal display monitors the whole process of mechanical operation, realizing ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and comparison, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of shaft wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic and conveying, and double cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of the vibration of the main engine on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
Concrete Inspection Well Module Brick Machine Equipment Distribution Box Traveling Formwork Box Demoulding Up Storage Box Door Closed Automatic Transport Plate All by the hydraulic system independently completed thereby to reduce mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, seals and hydraulic parts, which ensures the comprehensive performance of the equipment to be stable and reliable.
The mechanical excitation platform of shaft wall module adopts integral plate steel, and the mesa is wire-cut and clamped without welding points, so that the stuffing box can swing freely and guide, and the mechanical wear can be fully reduced.
The load of the mold is reduced, the filler is combined with two-in-one to encrypt the amplitude, and the integration, full synchronization, platform vibration and mode vibration are adopted to ensure the vibration effect.

Chongqing secondary vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship enrollment is an enterprise prospective employee-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status, and will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after enrollment.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, Standardize the enrollment procedures of secondary vocational schools and employment procedures of enterprises, Clarify the dual identities of apprentices in secondary vocational schools and prospective employees of enterprises, According to the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises must sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific posts, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentices on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship and cooperative enterprises to jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design personnel training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training academic system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional personnel training plan, and the internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can take 2 ~ 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required by each rotation training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot projects of modern apprenticeship in municipal secondary vocational schools in three batches, with the number of each pilot project being about 50, and training about 3,000 students (apprentices) in total.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implementation, and gradually advancing from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, it is mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the Novel Coronavirus Omicron variant is more mild than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of Omicron variant in South Africa, a physician organization composed of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body pain and cough, which are similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the group, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized yet.
"They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said.
He said that includes older patients and those with health problems, people who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
In contrast, he said, in the last Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. ".
In the two weeks since the Omicron variant strain was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
Although gathering enough data will take several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, which is half of the severe proportion of the previous epidemic; The average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while 20% of the early outbreaks in South Africa died.
"At the moment, almost all the indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He also said: "It is still early, and we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths occur late, and we are only two weeks into this wave of outbreaks. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the leading Novel Coronavirus strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng province saw a 400% increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, according to health officials, and tests showed the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What Should We Rely on to Save Abducted Children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan "No sale, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "collecting and abducting", mass prevention and treatment, and anti-abduction by the whole people make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not happen frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on missing children and find abducted children in time.
Hearing that this App is called "Reunion", I feel warm.
The new technical means are not only named "literature and art", but also full of feelings, and the informationization is used properly, practically and effectively.
The primary goal of law enforcement against abduction is to find abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Prioritize things. Under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", controversial topics such as "whether child trafficking should be subject to death" can be temporarily put aside and discussed carefully; But the rescue of abducted children can't wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the kidnapping operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step away from the parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective way such as "reunion" platform, which is directly helpful to solve cases and find children.
After all, "abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the whole legal system.
To crack down on crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation to the guarantee of justice and the meticulous law enforcement, it is necessary to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at the railway station, and their parents slept soundly, only to wake up to find that their children were gone.
A two-year-old child can't be expected to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, which are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party who buys abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the starting point of legal punishment in crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; If the circumstances are particularly serious, they may be sentenced to death and confiscated of property.
Under the general trend of "light punishment", crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime with heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts and weak legal awareness in raising children.
The legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we can't rely solely on the strict enforcement of the law by the government.
If the "market" of abduction exists widely, the traffickers are greedy for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, and form a situation of "fighting against the law" with law enforcers, and the anti-abduction action is bound to fall into an inefficient quagmire.
Therefore, getting rid of backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19 th CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress in Malanshan
Draw the strength of forging ahead from the party's hundred-year struggle history

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, with five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is an oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtration to remove foreign matters.
It can be divided into three levels according to different acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, elegant and pleasant plant fragrance, with acidity not exceeding 1%.
High quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure taste and aromatic.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): Taste and flavor are acceptable, and acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to blend taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution and refined.
After reading the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important index.
You know, olive fruits are just like grapes for brewing wine. Olive fruits from different producing areas and different olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for olive growth.
Except the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean Sea):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on. Similar to its climate, Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on are far south latitudes.
Olive picking month:
Every year from March to June, it is the time for olive trees to blossom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, and the fruits transition from green to red and purple, and finally turn black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils discovered so far.
The democracy summit ended, and Biden said that the fire of freedom will never go out
The online "Summit for Democracy", convened by US President Biden and attended by governments, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10th).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and autocratic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and an administrative councilor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the slight fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and everywhere. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resilient to the cushions and shocks of authoritarianism, and to those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges all over the world, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including using all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, addressed the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation in Hong Kong and ethnic Chinese minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) we have to make sure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary 　, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat [CPC] poses to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Tang Feng, an administrative councilor of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan Province, attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values" and released a "National Statement" by video, emphasizing that Taiwan Province stands at the forefront of confronting autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in fighting COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of retrogression.
However, in Taiwan Province, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and we can overcome false information without taking it off the shelves. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have seriously violated human rights, and at the same time impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice my hands first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often directly proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish it, the expensive normal situation will be friendlier than the cheap beat. This kind of "entry beat" is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very big, the hard ball can't hold it, and it is difficult for the master to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is-tennis is so difficult, knowing that you can't learn it, and knowing that you are not willing to buy expensive ones and make a bargain to fool you. If you play twice, you won't play again, so this racket is cheap and you don't feel bad.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have made progress. When the time comes, come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, and choose prince or Deng Lupu's. These two brands are not famous enough, so good racquets can't be sold at a price. It's good to shoot 500 or 600 new racquets. If you buy 200 second-hand racquets, don't you enjoy a thousand yuan?
It's friendly to novices, but it's chicken ribs after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed for delivery several times
Can you help me follow up?

Thank you

In fact, girls who are slightly fat pay much attention to dressing and matching.
The skirt worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long, and the length is almost at the knees, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the obesity on the legs will be revealed.
If it is too long, it will give people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear the upper, middle and lower sections, you will naturally increase, that is, the upper body, skirt and stockings will use different colors, which will produce a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for slightly fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to cover up your fat body. Noble and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for slightly fat girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially short black skirts, will make people think you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too conspicuous.
The more popular the better, and the color should not be too bright.
So as not to make people feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fat, they must tell the trick of dressing and matching.
Slightly fat girls should never wear tight short skirts. In addition, the jacket should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black stockings or grid socks (the kind with fine plaid). Choose a printed flared skirt with soft texture and a blouse with swinging collar, which can well cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, slightly fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
If a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a coat with the same color as the short skirt, which will make your fat body increase its height.
Short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, which is the most IN collocation in summer!
If you are MM with fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous dress.
It can not only cover your big belly, but also show your advantages.
A-shaped short skirt will be very thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. The jacket should be tight, and the layering will be thinner.
Simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Slightly fat girls can also wear fashion sense.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, girls who are slightly fat will be the focus of attention.
After the change in dressing and matching, we should also exercise more in our lives and strive to get rid of the label of slightly fat girls one day earlier, 😄

The girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think of a flesh injury"-Xinhuanet
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girls are willing to be'arrow targets' to raise money for their sisters" blew up the circle of friends.
Photographs show a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than people in Wulin Square, Hangzhou. The words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" are written on the wooden board, indicating that passers-by can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
This behavior caused a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of propaganda of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an excessive move only after collecting money for her sister, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' street "arrow target" fundraising was warned
In the online picture, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account number, WeChat account number and Alipay account number are written on another wooden board in front of her.
This picture caused controversy after surfing the Internet.
Some netizens think that this move is an "eye-catching begging behavior", and many netizens express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled the square around 10 am on the 23 rd. At that time, there were already many onlookers."
In an interview with local media, Tianshui Police Station near the incident said that there were two girls who set up stalls, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed beautifully.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl shouted at the edge, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, and now she is in urgent need of surgery. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of propaganda of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News that the girl named Ji Jiali raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, I can't think of a good way to raise money, so I made this behavior.
He said that in the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for helping, but she did not participate in it. No archery was found in the whole process, but someone watched and took photos and sent them to Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eye-catching fundraising method is not advocated".
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "Olympic Events where Project Managers Can Impact Gold Medals" is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, traveling on business and staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, not to mention putting out fires, carrying back pots and apologizing.
An article that seems to be a joke and ridicule also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability to manage the current project.
And people who are engaged in project management gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in their work through some actions.
According to the increasing number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professionals) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the "Report on the Development of Project Management in China for 20 Years (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP ® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed PMP ® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid certificates was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP ® certificates in the world.
In recent 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying the past "old experience". The rapidly changing working environment makes us know that we should learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many beginners of project management say that they can systematically master the ten fields and five process groups of project management by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and I don't know how to practice it; Lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land in work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and delayed project; The division of labor among members is unclear, and the "old slicker" in the team does not know how to deal with the unsmooth communication of cross-departmental assistance, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years and has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "Training Demonstration Base for R&D Management Talents of Chinese Enterprises", has come with the online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers".
The online course "Special Training Camp for R&D Project Managers" is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the actual combat cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
There is no evidence to say, so we can first see how other students evaluate this course: this course is not only made by Zhongtian Huaxia Expert Team (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combined with international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises to explain the course content in a simple and professional way.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform their learning contents into specific work after class.

According to the Survey and Analysis Report on Consumer Financial Literacy released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will remain the focus of financial education; According to the Report on the Debt Status of Chinese Youth released by Nielsen and the Report on the Consumption of Chinese Youth 2019-2020 released by CCTV Finance, The younger generation has great consumption potential, Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, Nearly half of the people have no debt accumulation, Although the younger generation presents a rational consumption trend as a whole, Although it is quite different from the label of "excessive profligacy" labeled by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, which leads to excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even leads to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave enough to assume social responsibility and give positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Gitzo has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, actively responding to the call of supervision, and taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, Gitzo continues to carry out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including college students. And through cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms, we can subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the arrival of the Double Twelfth, Gitzo reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
When spending, we must plan ahead and repay on time according to our ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse effects on economic life such as buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Gitzo will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products. Bring consumers more suitable and diversified services, constantly help the public to improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be reliable consumer financial partners for consumers all their lives.

Vietnam People's Daily Network-Gulf Cooperation Council meets common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is Crown Prince Mohammed's first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a blanket embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors there.
The Gulf Arab countries resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, which stems from the requirement of unity for the interests of all countries and regional stability, and aims to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long passage connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US $5 billion in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation worth US $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with talks between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA)-a deal condemned by Gulf Arab states for believing it could not resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.
Under the background that the nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran failed to meet the aspirations of Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of its kind among GCC countries since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time propose measures to make its member States cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is claimed that the exhaust sound of super running in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This car brought by our team is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar and Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, and the road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit a year. It is four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know if I count Xiaobian. According to the data, it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably when Xiaobian's myvi reaches 30km/h, people will reach 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissors doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
I don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it myself, and editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention has been paid, and everyone is watching wherever they go, which is very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's a little cool.)
The gas cost of 1km is about RM1 (the owner does not care at all)
Practice getting on and off the bus, or it will be a little awkward (because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The engine is too loud, and you will be deaf immediately after getting off the bus. (But it's still cool.)
The car body is too big, parking in an ordinary parking space will be very narrow, and I am afraid of being knocked by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian himself said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the super run of this video is not for sale, sorry!

Let the spirit of university resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running ideas and value pursuits accumulated in the long-term development process of a university, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is very important to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, Universities shoulder a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they rise in the autumn of national crisis, and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "helping the world by virtue, repairing Qi and governing peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "developing learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology and talents is intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines as a Whole" not only shows China's confidence and determination to move from a big country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development.
How to become one of the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time, speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize "overtaking in corners"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of backwardness, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, the academic level and school quality can be significantly improved; The second is cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brand and enhance image; Third, institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with the world advanced level.
In particular, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School-running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation, school-running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running a school: First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talents training, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education and combining schools and enterprises, and form a whole chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and symbolic interdisciplinary achievements; Third, highlight the characteristics of school-running system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University's industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always stick to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovating", the common values of "Diligence, Xiu De, Distinguishing and Being Honest", and the latest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit are composed of "Heiner River, Enlightening Truth and Virtue, Opening Things Before People, and Building Our Country".
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct direction of running schools, accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, reflecting the mind of "the world's talents are used by me", which is manifested in absorbing the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people in world famous schools; "Kai Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the challenge of personality while pursuing truth; "Opening things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also the reform and development, innovation and innovation; "Building Our Country" emphasizes patriotism and dedication, and says that universities should always share prosperity and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"Those who are wise listen to silence, while those who are wise see invisible".
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the era position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should stick to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit stir with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thus providing inexhaustible motive force for realizing national prosperity and national rejuvenation and realizing the common ideal of mankind.

When NFT rushed out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game named "Axie Infinity" had a great impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of games including NFT. It is the NFT project with the highest transaction volume at present, and has exceeded 3 billion US dollars up to now.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, which is close to the glory of the king.
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has passed on a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contract, players are no longer a single role, and can not only get fun and economic benefits from the game, but also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of investment target industries. First of all, we must choose industries with large growth space and at least 100 billion market size; Secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market size, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Come on for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the tactical layout of 2021 and 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right", that is, to do things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, tactics lie in landing, and there is room for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On the basis of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new ones; On top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7th, El Salvador, a small Central American country, made Bitcoin legal tender, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12th, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares to launch Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, which marked the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in enrollment of three Ivy League schools such as Yale-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted complaints to the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against the discrimination of Asian applicants by three Ivy League schools-Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College in the enrollment process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which took the lead in initiating the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of famous American schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three famous American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "discriminate against Asian applicants for a long time and systematically" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission ratio for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change the enrollment policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities complained have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in Harvard University's enrollment, but the US Department of Education refused to accept it for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani Americans also participated in the complaint.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from the housing agency. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family member of the owner of the house, about the details of purchasing the factory building, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt of Deposit for Factory Sales", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled. Return to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory sales contract within one week."
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sale and payment method, which led to the delay in signing the housing sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
I finally took a fancy to the house, and the deposit was paid and the house price was ready, so I just signed the contract, but the seller didn't sell it, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Lin to Yuyao People's Court.
After trial, the court held that the failure of both parties to sign a formal contract could not only be attributed to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty of deposit should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract by doubling the return of deposit.
After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminder] We should fulfill the necessary duty of care in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill the necessary duty of care, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied or not, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a speech on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw a line with ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, practice anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatist confrontation and divert domestic contradictions".
According to the Chinese government, "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out'democratic transformation ', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated the'color revolution', resulting in disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long been a "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to deliver on his campaign promise.
The two-day conference, conducted by video, featured invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices internationally and in the United States, for example, criticizing some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people suspect that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize this summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
"Today's American democracy is morbid, with money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, polarization between the rich and the poor, etc.", and American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital, the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more able to resist the buffer and impact of autocracy, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuous and worrying challenges".
The United States has pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long initiative that includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all our countries fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year.".

The taste is like the service is warm and the meat is good

How to drink red card whisky?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like collecting, some people like delicious food, and of course some people like wine tasting. Red card whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries at present, and Red card whisky has won the gold medal in the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of red card whisky has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, you will spoil its mellow flavor.
So how do you drink red card whisky?
Xiaobian gives you a brief introduction.
How to drink red card whisky:
Johnnie Walker Red Card Whiskey is a blend of about 35 kinds of Scotch whisky. It has rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky. The rich aroma has sweet and smoky aroma.
The mouth is mellow and fresh, with a slight flavor of vanilla and strong smoked malt.
This wine can be drunk directly on ice or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red card whisky has entered China. In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, red card whisky + coke, Sprite or Sunkis and other bubble drinks have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize sour taste, but also bring pleasure to people visually. Adding drinks can dilute the taste of wine and change the taste.
Red card whisky + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar is also acceptable), which is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
Authentic red Fangwei tastes sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, while lemon will bring fresh fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be blended according to personal tastes and hobbies.
The above three are the best ways to drink red card whisky. You can try it as a reference. I hope the introduction of Xiaobian can help you.
Educational thinking: How to make "Xueba" and "Xuezha" get their places in college examinations-Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the college examination, and put forward the demands of improving the difficulty of the examination, changing the examination questions, and making the examination truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, college examinations have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and different learning levels.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are single, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may pass the exam by concentrated assault. If they think of other ways, they may get twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "learning slag" that can pass the customs without investment, and even get high scores; "Xueba" never leaves class at ordinary times, and his homework and notes are all good, and his exams are not much higher than the "strange status quo".
From this point of view, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems in college examinations are not without reason, and I believe this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise these three students who wrote letters directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for exams by surprise, think of various ways to "take" exam questions from teachers, try to delimit the scope of exams, and get "key counseling" before exams. It is not an anecdote to even carry cheat sheets in exams and ask teachers to raise their hands after exams.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, to measure whether a university examination is qualified or not lies in teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to master the basic knowledge points of a subject in an all-round way is the content to be investigated in college examinations.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of disciplines. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, but it is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, "I learned the basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago, and I am still learning it, which is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination usually forms a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject make overall plans to form the examination paper, and all the teachers who undertake the subject participate in the examination marking, so as to overcome the repetition of the examination questions to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning, According to the overall situation of students' learning, the difficulty of questions is normally distributed. It is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can dynamically grasp the difficulty and questions, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also give attention to the examination of ability, and at the same time carry out innovative design of questions.
Examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' advice letters, and has deployed rectification plans in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course final examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and examination links, refine performance evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving the problems of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an issue that university examination needs to face. Of course, it is necessary to introduce a corresponding system, but Kung Fu is more important in daily life, which requires teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to thoroughly understand the teaching content, but also to thoroughly understand the students' learning situation, so that teaching and learning will be better connected and form a benign interaction, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "learning tyrants" and "learning scum" can get their places.
If you can't change the location of the branch for me, can you change it to delivery?
Then I don't have to give you more money, do I?
My colleague's order has been delivered
You can't finish it
What about GPS? Have you arrived yet
Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street Store) has no branch yet
Before taking pictures, because our time was not arranged well, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lan Lan patiently arranged the time for us.
Later, I chose a weekend with fine weather.
Mrs. King's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are excellent.
It was the first time in my life that I made up formally. Wow ~ I can't believe I will look so good one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I can't remember the name) are super patient and natural in makeup.
The location was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was fine that day, and I didn't feel very cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headdresses from time to time, and helped us arrange them immediately if there was a little trouble.
Photographers are also very humorous, and they feel very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, Because I saw many cases on the Internet, I don't want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, we didn't mean to add photos at all. I didn't add any of the 24 photos in the direct package (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time, more than 10,000 photos were added to the more than 7,000 packages. At that time, I was shocked and I was afraid that I would choose too many photos)
Today, the photos were repaired, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them and felt that they were not very good. They immediately repaired them for me.
Turn out the photos taken by my sister before and compare them. I think I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
Sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos with Mrs. Xuan Hanjin!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. King is grateful to have you and sincerely wishes you happiness and bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah did not report that raw paper was out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The National Registration Office of Sabah said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it has been impossible to issue raw paper to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200 so far.
However, Kailu Aminus, director of the bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for the paper are recorded in the system and will be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained a report by an online media that the printing problem of raw paper in Sabah newspaper had appeared for as long as 10 months.
He said that the relevant problems appeared two months ago, and Sarawak is facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper paper is different from that in other regions, so it is impossible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kailu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed it over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah for the final stage of printing immediately. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant within 2 working days (December 20)."
"We will inform applicants to go to local branches to collect the raw paper."

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone", and the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document requesting to strengthen the prevention and control of epidemic situation in port cities-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of epidemic situation in port cities and novel coronavirus pneumonia. It is required that those who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) should hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to land border port cities should have at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce them to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
Implementing the policy of regional differentiation management, changing from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillovers, and achieve maximum results in epidemic prevention and control with minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clustered epidemics in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as untimely monitoring and early warning of epidemic situation in some places, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk post personnel, regular nucleic acid detection becoming a mere formality, inadequate disinfection of cold chain goods in all links, irregular management of centralized isolation places, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response of epidemic situation.
According to the notice, efforts should be made from nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, so as to speed up the filling of shortcomings in prevention and control in port cities, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and weave a tight defense line for external defense input.
The circular stressed that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work simultaneously, publish and unblock the hotline for people's livelihood security, regularly investigate the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts and flags) where the open land, waterway and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures and leagues) where they are located and the municipalities directly under the Central Government where they are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in time.

Oil pipeline video starts with the truth of bloodthirsty killing of the US military for 20 years-Xinhuanet
(Video source: Tubing)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary named "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted wide attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, being militaristic, bloodthirsty, killing innocent people and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Abuse of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort humanity and set up killing teams.
In the past 20 years, American troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to torture and humiliate the "suspects".
Crimes against humanity have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "more anti-terrorism".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only the devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, talking about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help make canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company. Here, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged milk powder are exactly the same as those of canned milk powder, and there is no difference.
Then people will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of bagged bags one year, while the shelf life of tinned bags two years or longer?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between tin and bag so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive ones are good.
There are also consumers who react after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of canned clothes is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why cans are expensive and where are they expensive?
Their raw materials are the same. Why is the price difference so large?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profits generated by manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit, so what can manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a great increase in the pricing of tinned clothes to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly push cans instead of bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers have to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine.
Then, with the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as the promotional staff of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses, are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are tinned, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, by hook or by crook, linked with doctors in hospitals, who assist in the promotion of products, and draw profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
However, China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is suggested that you buy bagged milk powder and put it in cans on the premise of having cans at home, which can save costs, increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned bags is longer than that of bagged bags. If the shelf life of canned bags is the same as that of bagged bags after opening bags, it just means that bagged bags are not easy to preserve and easy to be affected with damp and deteriorate.

Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" before telling you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that "how to do it" is actually the most important and fundamental link.
For this reason, these books all have a common feature-either do the best in one go, or do nothing at all; Either 100 or 0; Either you will climb Mount Tai, or you will simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" will admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, turn over a new leaf, and make a great change of 180 degrees", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to the rules, follow the old ways and refuse to change, you have to shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will make a fool of oneself in front of the word "change", and it is difficult to make up their minds; Or, with a temporary impulse, I made a painful determination to "change" and bravely took the first step, but it often didn't last long, and I couldn't persist for a while before I lost, so it was difficult to see continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that vividly shows this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people and makes most people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a possible way for more ordinary people to embark on the road of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold"-it encourages a theory of "accumulating small wins into big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because it is better than standing still.
In a word, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing.
Because the threshold is greatly lowered, it is more possible for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
To sum up, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone succeed, what it can inspire in the end is actually a few; The "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Agriculture and Rural Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, which was more than 40 times higher than the initial protection period in 2002.
Naked carp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake dropped sharply due to factors such as mass hunting and degradation of the breeding water environment of naked carp. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake to raise fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main rivers entering Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially proliferated and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in western China.
In order to protect the ecological environment of Sanjiangyuan region and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wild animals and maintain the biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on fishing ban in key waters of Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

It's been an hour, and it hasn't arrived yet
I just read an article about my period. It's too long.
Give popular science to men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and amenorrhea will occur around the age of 50.
After that, it will come regularly once a month on the premise of good health.
However, it is not regular enough to accurately predict. The tolerance of about one week needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes it will overturn if it is unlucky (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some for three days and some for one week; Some people flow less, and some people collapse; Some people don't respond, some people are in pain until they are transported away by ambulance, and dysmenorrhea will change with time. No pain before doesn't mean no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, and bleeding occurs 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end. All you can do is suck blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing to clothes chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Eating ibuprofen quickly before dysmenorrhea at the beginning of physiological period can effectively relieve the pain in the current month. It is useless to eat again after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before physiological period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you probably arrive at the cycle, you will have diarrhea inexplicably, and you will have menstruation within two days.
Sanitary napkins should be replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 tablets. If you add the portions prepared in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify here. You don't need to change tampons frequently. You can change tampons every five or six hours, and the longest is eight hours.)
Menstrual hormones may be irritable, and ovulation will be unstable because of hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body will stumble on itself.
But official crime figures show that women still have a high level of emotional control, and they don't use emotional problems as excuses.
It's not just blood, it includes the shed endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, the house is built (the endometrium thickens) to welcome the guests. If the guests do not come, all of them will be torn down (menstruation is discharged) and a new house will be built next month, which goes on and on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades in a row, bleeding 24 hours a day every month, and abdominal pain and low back pain. Who is willing?
But a person can be born because his mother has had menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women to say that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed.
If someone feels sick from menstruation, I feel disgusted by the preparation of women's bodies for giving birth to life, It shouldn't be said in public. Girls stand up and stop thinking like this. Men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can this attitude face their mother and want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons. They are really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival, and it is disappointing to send it wrong
To order another meal for children
I hope that the store will check the products during its busy schedule
Is it electric leakage when soaking feet in the foot bath tub?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a very good role in pedicure and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bath tubs are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. Foot bath tubs ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan are dazzling, giving consumers a great choice.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, health appliances such as foot bath tubs are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot bath tubs, so there are certain potential safety hazards.
"It is too dangerous to soak your feet in charged water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath tub for his father as a birthday present, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt numb on the soles of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath tub, but when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt the soles of his feet numb.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath tub was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was not bad. Although he returned the foot bath tub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this foot bath tub, which has been popular for a long time, now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on setting the maximum temperature, which people it is suitable for, and which materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, in general, there will be no electrification problem in the foot bath tub, but it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a split foot bath tub.
Water and electricity are separated without any potential safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen at will.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo-Viewpoint Headline-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All-media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference were held in Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture and speeding up the goal of sprinting 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony that the source of lake red lies in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of tea industry, promoted the construction of 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan and Four Waters Colorful Tea".
The tea industry in the province has intensified innovation, and the main teas such as green tea, black tea and black tea have taken turns to exert their strength. The main tea producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism and driven the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The wind and water turn around, and black tea exerts its strength again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has soared.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua welcomed the "Source of Lake Red".
In Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea named "Binglichun" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic situation and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea is red, which injects tea culture connotation, is popular and traded, and Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't send it up because there was no parking below
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation name "Metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is called the way, and the metaphysical is called the device" in the Book of Changes, which was translated by Metaphysic by Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
Metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is "to study which nouns represent real existence entities and which nouns only represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, which was put forward by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of not saying a word about God.
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a philosophical branch that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and studies human moral life. Here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (judging various moral values and giving moral guidelines and suggestions for correct or wrong behaviors.
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made by the actual moral agent and observed, which contributes to all the moral factors of this choice. It studies the ethics held by social groups.
Ethical history includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Walla and Montaigne.
Part II: Ethical thoughts of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics of politics, Represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empiricist ethics, Representative: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, Representative: Spinoza and others, In the 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, Representative: Voltaire and others, In the 18th and 19th centuries, German academic ethics, Representative: Kant and Hegel, In the 18th and 19th centuries, British utilitarian ethics, Representative: Bentham and Sikivik, In the 19th century, English evolutionary ethics, Representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, etc., German neo-Kantian ethics in the late 19th century, Li Kaier, etc., neo-Hegelian ethics in the late 19th century, Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (irrational ethics, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.).
Logic is a subject that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a subject with the theme of studying the essence and significance of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance in the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally sent an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and started families and worked.
It was your righteous deeds that helped us families in distress get through the most difficult times.
At present, COVID-19 pandemic is raging all over the world, and most donors have retired at the age of.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to stop donating money to our mother group in Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Pottery Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by IFCSS and Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the National Association for Learning and Self-help and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often cross.

Relief money often cannot be delivered smoothly to June 4th.
In 1994, upon the suggestion of Teacher Ding, "Mother Tiananmen Square" set up a special team to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4th Orphan Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphan Relief Fund", which has been implemented ever since.
These projects are mainly funded by campus and social donations in June 4th, generous donations from individuals and supported by the Democracy Foundation of Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of June 4 finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of June 4.
During this period, "Human Rights in China" also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding stopped donating on June 4th for the sake of donors. We are all retired people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect our decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous and courageous colleagues who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian aid money for many years.

A programming white who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, you'd better learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to study.
However, if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose self-study, but you will be tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless. Of course, the teachers of some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing, and it is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of this institution know what this institution is like and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a great relationship with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all these will be related to the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and you haven't graduated yet, Or a computer major has graduated, so if there is enough time, I personally suggest self-study, which is the lowest efficiency and cost. Nowadays, many offline training institutions are actually very good, but the first learning cost is high, and the second investment time is more, which basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources when going to bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for study, it is recommended to study in a training institution, so that it is not very laborious to study, the teacher explains it in detail, and some people answer questions specially. In addition, it is also helpful in study planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and recommend to go to the company after studying, so that a lot of things can be saved in the interview process of finding a job later.
These are some of my views. Because I don't know your situation, I only introduce it in detail. If you have anything else to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, and I saw it all in the App

When I was a child, happiness is a thing, and having it is happiness; When you grow up, happiness is a goal, and you will be happy when you reach it; After maturity, it is found that happiness is a state of mind, and happiness is realized.
Be the truest and kindest self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, take your own road; Two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful and never too old!
At every stage of life, we will encounter different problems.
Most of the time, it is not your ability that binds you, but your courage to face it positively.
Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you face the difficulties, the problems will be solved easily.
The curators of China and Saudi Arabia jointly held the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia, the Diriye Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the JAX Art District in Diriye, northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
This Biennale is jointly planned by Saudi Diriere Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling Stone", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling Stone", "Inheriting as an Experiment", "Thinking at the Edge", "Going to the Public", "Brave New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total exhibits, including painting, installation art and performing arts; The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted much attention, and some artists use recycled materials to create in novel ways. For example, Bing Xu reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in "Endless Picture of Xishan in the Story Series Behind" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of Dirie Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this Biennale will establish an international dialogue, so that the global audience will have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community and strengthen interaction.
Tian Yuyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, which can not only enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennial, in which artists, curators and opinion leaders of creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Standardizing the Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to provide employment assistance for the poverty-stricken population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation and difficulties tackling, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts, which are used to resettle the poverty-stricken laborers and other rural disadvantaged groups, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to achieve employment income increase, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation and effectively improve the rural public service capabilities.
The new regulations were jointly issued by Yunnan People's Society, Rural Revitalization, Finance and other seven departments, which mainly standardized the target scope, fund management, post development, post management and other aspects of grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare posts.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that the post should be set according to the principles of "setting up posts according to needs, appointing people according to posts, dynamic management, total amount control", "who develops, who uses and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary openness and unified management".
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, examination, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement of posts.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that all rural public welfare post development departments should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare post resettlement personnel; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the payment of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.

Second, although the Rightists have achieved success in history, they are not long, so they are short because they are brilliant when they give some sunshine and sweat when they drink some boiled water; If you are a little successful, you will be able to look at Shu, and if you are hit, you will be attached.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the Rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing economy, improving science and technology, promoting administrative institutionalization and safeguarding human rights, the positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
However, I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I think that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to take advantage of the fire by political speculation are not Rightists, but assholes.
Let's talk about left again.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left will not have this nature, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting left epilepsy while fighting against thieves, and they were quite angry. I don't think it is necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left epilepsy. They are all the same tendons and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti-thief and left epilepsy admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thief scolds you for five hairs, and when the left epilepsy scolds you for the right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
And the ideal gradually drifted away, and even slaughtered the dragon and became an evil dragon at the end of the year.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. The innate genes of history and culture in China lead to the left of China as a whole.
In China, the right is free and pays attention to efficiency and development, while the left strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and security.
At present, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States will struggle to the left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although you can't understand it, you will be finished if you like it
Don't say anything, Huahua is so brave
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists not only caused Huawei to fall into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The US imperialists suppressed China's chip industry, Requiring their own enterprises and related enterprises in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time, the direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing the disorder of chip supply chain shortage worldwide.
Nowadays, "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production of car companies and the price increase of mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", technology giants in more and more countries began to take the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, Laomei has recently acted frequently and presided over the "Chip Summit"; It also invited 64 giants to set up semiconductor alliances, and allocated funds to support American local technology giants. For example, Intel, an old technology giant of the United States, spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as an old technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves, which is bound to rise rapidly in a short time and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made amazing remarks. Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples about Intel's investment in building a fab: It is quite ironic for Intel to build a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still resents a feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of American manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world and being the overlord in the world semiconductor field.
By 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode, and chips were designed, manufactured, sealed and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be discouraged from facing huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by the market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a company specializing in chip design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be set up.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims at the single link of "wafer processing" in its main business, and only provides OEM services for wafer manufacturing without design.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was wannabe in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once looked for Intel Capital, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of chip industry, it obviously thought highly of itself, looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also decided that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
I didn't expect the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services in those days to start wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou found it ironic that Intel entered wafer foundry.
Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel still stays at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Don't wait

Let's look at some "strange hot searches" today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the rise of dragons on February 2nd, the price increase of Haoliyou, and the Lalamove incident. The spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then the "exponential decline" (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will reappear.
They look no different from the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed by official website, the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing "isolated peak", "serrated" and "cliff-like".
"Lonely peak" means artificial heating, which quickly rushes to the hot search and attracts public attention; "Sawtooth" means periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; "Cliff-like" means collective evacuation. The hot search has played its "function", received new tasks and rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that the unified batch of water troops received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: Dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war and create momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, and which entangle decision-making. Black production accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks by will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

The first case of Omicron strain infection was found in Mauritius and other countries-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12-Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first case of COVID-19 variant virus Omicron strain infection.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time on the 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, an infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; Another infected person, a local resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30th after contacting a person who recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cypriot Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it had confirmed three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in Cyprus.
All three students came back from a trip abroad at the beginning of this month, and they were not hospitalized because they were all mild.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron strain, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th next year, passengers over 12 years old who enter the country by air will have to receive nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
Serbia's Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Kunbize Chiponda said on the 9th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were found for the first time in Malawi.
The country's health department carried out genome sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these 3 cases of infection.

Damei 360 integrated home improvement
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No.156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to have a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
When I came to the store, I began a series of tricks.
I went to the store for the first time and only showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the field to measure the house. They actually quoted me a price saying that my 135 house of 70,000 can be done. They roughly showed me their materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that as soon as you arrive at the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the money, you will never return it unless you have enough experience to fight with them in theory).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. When my mind is impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 deposits.
His offer to me had a lot of problems. 70,000 did not include water and electricity renovation, and did not include any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, and these three were the bulk of the cost of basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at first.
When I asked them for a refund, they showed great experience and had a small team to deal with you.
It's the customer's problem that they will bite to death in one bite anyway, and they are totally irresponsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, there are many details, don't want to say one by one are tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend looking for them to decorate the house is also of poor quality, and I will calculate various expenses for you later.
Pit dad, they are the original deceptive faucet decoration, and now they are changed into Damei, which seems to have closed down and changed into other ones.
So don't choose such a decorating company.
In the future, when you choose Baidu, look at these and check these consultations because decoration is not a small sum of money.

Isn't there any other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, you must pursue it.
I asked if I could cancel it in less than 15 minutes

There are about the same Geminid meteor shower in the starry sky, which ushered in a great deal on the 14 th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower this year, Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14, and friends who like meteor shower can observe it in the middle of the night.
An Jiu, an astronomy enthusiast in Beijing, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent body of most meteor showers is periodic comets, but the parent body of Geminid meteor shower is asteroid Phaeton No.3200, which is an Apollo asteroid.
Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by comets.
Xiu Lipeng, director of Tianjin Astronomical Society and expert in astronomical science popularization, said that just like New Year's blockbusters, Geminid meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow, and is called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere together with quadrant meteor shower and Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of Geminid meteor shower is that meteoroids are slow, colorful and have many fireball, which is suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin, photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14th, and the ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Recommended index map of Geminid meteor shower.
"Last year, people were deeply impressed by the colorful Geminid meteor shower, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the wonderful degree will be discounted a little.
14th is November 11th of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is full and convex. Bright moonlight will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of Geminid meteor shower will rise higher at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the last few hours when the moon falls behind in the middle of the night, but pay attention to cold and warmth. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place with high altitude, little light damage and wide field of vision facing northeast in suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets for visual observation.
It should be noted that the flow of Geminid meteor shower in all directions is very large, so it is not necessary to stare at the radiation point of Geminid meteor shower all the time during observation.
Friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous meteor shower movies, it is best to choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and continuity, tripods, backup batteries and cable release are also essential. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser tv and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the title should refer to LCD TV, and the differences between laser tv and LCD TV in market positioning mainly include the following two points:
First, laser tv focuses more on the big screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser tv obviously focuses more on the big screen market, or laser tv itself is a product for the big screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser tv is generally over 75 inches, and the largest one is over 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, laser tv's global shipments and sales have been increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of laser tv market will increase by more than 140%, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why laser tv has achieved such good results in the big screen market is mainly attributed to its outstanding performance in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection in laser tv, the light emitted by laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to eyes is less.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparative test of watching laser tv and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data prove that laser tv does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
With more and more attention paid to vision health, laser tv not only attracts more and more users by virtue of its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser tv focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the declining price of LCD TV, the current price of laser tv is mostly over 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser tv so expensive?
It must make sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser tv has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can't achieve.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser tv is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can realize the 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, which requires little space, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser tv can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the calorific value is lower, the equipment loss is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV sets are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system and bionic screen, which can bring more shocking audio-visual experience to users.
There is no false demand, but the product of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser tv is not a dish for audio-visual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing it, you can judge for yourself, and you are afraid to listen to one side of the story.
To put it simply, laser tv, a super wide-angle near-focus projector, has to use expensive super wide-angle lenses and mirrors in order to be close to the curtain, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the Fresnel curtain with microstructure is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by 65 inches of liquid crystal.
Another point, I especially hate projection manufacturers' selling point that diffuse reflection is good for eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that eyes can see is direct light for eyes. If you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. It must be true that LCD TV is also diffuse "direct". Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the projection curtain is not diffuse reflection, it can't be image at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain curtain is just ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

After adding the WeChat appointment date, my little sister sent me the optional time schedule, and the reply information was timely ~
Before going, I saw the shooting works in the store, more of which were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my little sister, patiently helped me try two sets of clothes with my tangled style, and finally decided to start makeup modeling ~ The photographer will put some props before shooting, guide the movements, and strive for perfection in every detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, the shooting style is not what I want, but it should be a good-looking 🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer will help to select photos and exchange later styles, which makes me feel very careful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film, waiting for the effect ~
For the second time, I won the overlord meal activity of photo class ~ most of the clothes in the audience can choose one to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black veil to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the post-95 s, and he feels a little green. I hope I can give more suggestions on the guidance of customers' shooting actions in the future ~ it is quite talkative and the shooting process is pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Museum Preferred Quality Store Reply
On the homepage, let's take a look at Queenie ~
When you go to the store, you can fill in your name and phone number first and then choose your clothes. You can choose your wedding dress. It is quite patient to change three or four sets of clothes. After you choose it, you have made up for a long time and your service attitude is good. After shooting, you will teach you how to pose, that is, you feel that your face is so big. It takes half a month to refine it, and it will be sent in three or four days. It feels as if it is no different from the original film.
The "environment" as a whole is fine.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, with the studio inside.
"Service" is very warm and careful.
The stylist is very patient.
Photographers will also teach you movements seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will take the initiative to make up the shot.
[Experience] The shape may be a bit too much. The original double eyelids were posted with three eyelids.
The eyebrow tail has also been shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who don't thrushes everyday.
Photos ten days to give, but the effect of the Pchart is not satisfactory, feeling the double eyelid paste those are still very obvious.
Because I don't know what style I want, I tried two sets and chose the black dress. Miss said that this set is more Hepburn's retro style
After choosing clothes, I began to make up my hair. The hairdresser and makeup artist are super patient and help me get it. The effect is very satisfactory
After finishing my makeup and hair, I began to take pictures. The photographer directed me to pose all the way. The process was relaxed and harmonious
After filming, I carefully selected four favorite ones to be refined. My little brother said that the ending of the film within 15 years was very satisfied ~
There has been no reply for 3 days... Because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the # PRS_ORG # plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay the freight every time now
You can waive it first, and then charge my monthly fee after your investigation. Is this OK?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, and the minimum limit is RMB 50 million before they can be established, which must be approved by the CIRC.
These three articles are actually very harsh, To sum up, we must have strength, It must be approved by the national authority department of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks in the whole country), and shareholders should have a good style. As an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the insured need not question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which cannot be achieved by any insurance company.
At this point, it is not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Mary No.5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance, and Small Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because they reduce the operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesmen's wages, are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment, reduces the payment pressure of policyholders, and at the same time can incite the leverage of insurance to the maximum extent.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: This is particularly important, Because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements, Many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insuring, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it, which is prone to many hidden dangers of claims settlement and may be refused compensation.
I have done insurance telephone sales in Tencent Micro Insurance (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is true and reliable. People are unreliable. There are no professional employees in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example, 1 yuan has insurance coverage of 6 million yuan, buys insurance to send mobile phones, and receives 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important points and will not tell the insured that 1 yuan in the first month and the next month need to be charged according to normal charges, ranging from tens to 200 yuan. It is unclear what many customers bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company lost 6 million yuan.
Free mobile phone delivery is only delivered by special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not exchange it and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the insured.) It is short-term to get 60,000 serious illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, what can 60,000 do? It can't solve the problem, and your life will start streaking in the future.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, on the whole, there is no problem with the platform and products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is suggested that the subject should consider it carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, and each person saved 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
Me: Minya insurance broker, With 3 years of enterprise management training experience, I have served nearly 1,000 enterprise users and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers according to their needs. During insurance, I will shop around for customers and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will do policy sorting and policy custody for customers, so that customers can feel at ease.
Grow up with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance processes independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all the steps can be completed by the insured independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a sense of "ceremony", and may not even have a printed paper contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract at all.
This mode is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem when buying insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

Thank you for your help
From before to now, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, and I can't accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we just want to put an end to such villains.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that we must resist first.
Since you started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting teasing posts, and then trying to post the so-called home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, figure, good fertility, what kind of strawberries are planted in bed, and whether to insert such messages, I... Forget it.
How do you know? Later, I received many friends' comments about uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments on your Facebook friend account?
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news of my alarm was uploaded, you didn't converge at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are. In our society, we need respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of ridiculous, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks, you can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think any girl would want to let others humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, How are you?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say that she is fine after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic moral character will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut off some messages for everyone to comment on
No one can pretend to be you if you post it yourself
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
A knowing smile
Vietnam People's Daily-Vietnamese Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major meetings were held during the Third Vietnamese National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, and the topics discussed revolved around two major themes: digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the epidemic in novel coronavirus pneumonia.

The US three aircraft carriers gather the most powerful weapons around China. Rare visits to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-Chinese media multi-dimensional reports: The latest news on Sino-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; The US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to American allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier was discovered by satellite near Barabak Strait.
Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform predicts that the Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
The US aircraft carriers cruising in the Pacific Ocean now include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, in addition to the Carl Vinson.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, is currently deployed by the US Navy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Lake Champlain" guided missile cruiser and the "Stockdahl" guided missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to a report by CNN) 1 on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The US three aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China, and made a rare visit to Guam. According to the analysis, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time that a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since 1980s.
US three aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China, rarely visit Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in Spratly Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness and continuous commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of 14 "Thunder Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make Thunder Submarines "the most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity". This system also includes silo ballistic missiles located in the United States and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the evaporation of US $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition". Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function orientation, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected with Meta advertisements, which are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users' data and information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, which will clearly prompt users whether to allow App to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's income growth has also weakened before (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies with marine business.
Meta has several hundred offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in mainland China.
Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel for Chinese companies to expand overseas markets, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, TT of bytes is one of Meta's main competitors now, but Meta can make a lot of money from bytes in the past two years.
Every agent in China is helping bytes to advertise in Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
Recently, I didn't know it specifically, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are out of Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but more importantly, it is expected to look at the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told "metaverse".
Metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very beautiful now, it also has an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although several of his social softwares have a relatively high daily life and are also mainstream social softwares, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, and subversion is just a blink of an eye.
And engaging in the unattainable concept of metaverse, There is no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, and it is a road of no return. Above are some of my thoughts for reference.
