Students play the leading role in the annual academic conference of Zhejiang University. The research results greatly open people's brains - Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, breathe hard to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements that greatly opened the brain were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical treatment, life science, humanities education, etc. The students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your family checkup doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You just need to breathe in gently, and this instrument can preliminarily detect the health status of your body from the components of the gas you breathe out."
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone. After exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material. Its target is chemical elements. Its keen "smell" enables it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgical lamp: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of the traditional surgical lamp and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The lack of early detection and resection of many diseases is related to the lamp used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time during the early cancer examination, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which can enhance the discrimination of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the operation needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried in Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the national challenge cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most some soap and hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device."
As long as we stand on the washstand, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands!"
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second global major challenges summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skill certificates that I think are important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in case of emergencies, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really have heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, according to our official data, three million people die unexpectedly every year, and the most dangerous one is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70% or 80% can be saved, and less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing. "
This is what Lu Le, the founder of first reaction, said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, his breathing and heartbeat are gone, there is no effect in pinching him.
Artificial respiration and chest compression are necessary to save people.
I found that few of us have this awareness to learn first aid now, but it's too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time in the face of emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students still have discounts.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals to be completed before the age of 25. It was a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the goal list, but it was really completed!
Then I'm going to take an examination of other certificates I want to take an examination of. I plan to take an examination of a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first aid certificate to take an examination of this certificate, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

First of all, I think "Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in all senses.
But if you want to say whether the film has no bright spot, it's not. At least the soundtrack selection is very good.
There are many kinds of bad films, including those that make you fall asleep in the cinema and those that make you angry after watching them. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted at insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in grams of novels, which is difficult to describe. There are many loopholes like the windbreaker on brother pony.
Even after reading it, you will doubt whether there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let's briefly talk about some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male owner should live on an island in the south and depend on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan.
The old man watched the snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father are very relieved about this.
Then the old man was gone.
How did his brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small gangsters of the island's flying car party easily close a mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feeling is too obvious.
Why does a small gangster flying car party with poor credit reporting and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of usury, why didn't the police call the police? In the movie, the police specially asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but he doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to sit outside the room and sleep for a night without finding the hotel owner?
This kind of inexplicable plot is full of the whole film. Because the plot is so outrageous that I feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the theme of the film, or the film has no theme at all, which is an abominable stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you think it may be a drama that wants to reflect the difficult survival of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't know what you saw at all. With it, you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do you go to the cinema to enjoy shit during the Spring Festival.
For most people, they are also very familiar with the routines of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie succeeds step by step.
If you want to make a romantic film, then you should honestly talk about the feud between the young people in the town who like to ride motorcycles and the waitress sister.
If you want to reflect the reality, at least your plot can't appear anything contrary to the normal world.
(for example, Yin Zheng's new motorcycle has just been burned and can sing), you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
As for the fact that the hostess is clearly not retarded, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
I also don't understand why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen to add crash plots to his own films?
Is such a film arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?

Such as: various inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks, small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. of drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the modules are concave convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of shaft wall is much better than that of flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combined masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the horizontal holes are connected. After the hole core is poured, the cast-in-place concrete network structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproof.
The module is provided with joint bar slots vertically and horizontally, and the horizontal and longitudinal joint bars correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection well and drainage well built with concrete inspection well module are not easy to collapse, sink, leak and other phenomena. The shaft wall module has stable mechanical performance, simple operation and standard forming size.
The intelligent control of brick machine equipment of concrete manhole module is equipped with data input and output devices. One touch LCD monitors the whole process of mechanical operation, realizing the ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis and comparison, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of shaft wall module adopts single cylinder hydraulic pressure and transmission, and double cylinder hydraulic pressure and transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, so as to ensure the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete manhole module brick machine equipment distribution box moves, the mold box demoulds and rises, the storage box door is closed, and the automatic conveying support plate is completed independently by the hydraulic system, so as to reduce the wear and maintenance of machinery.

Chongqing secondary vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship enrollment is the enterprise prospective employees - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who accept the pilot training also have apprenticeship status. After enrollment, they will be pre enrolled as employees by the pilot enterprises.
According to the requirements of the Municipal Education Commission, the enrollment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises should be standardized, and the dual identities of secondary vocational school students and enterprise prospective employees of apprentices should be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises should sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices over the age of 16 but under the age of 18, apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises should sign agreements to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents, rights and interests protection of apprentice training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training school system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training program, and the post internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can bring 2 ~ 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot, and a total of about 3000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of pilot before implementation and gradual promotion from point to area, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission power, most of them are mild diseases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of covid-19 is more mild than that caused by the delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the associated press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a doctors' organization composed of more than 5000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they currently treat are relatively mild, such as physical pain, cough and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patient needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said, "they can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more vulnerable to severe coronavirus infection.
He said that in contrast, in the last wave of delta epidemic, the patients he treated with covid-19 had "dyspnea and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. "
Within two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the conclusion of the National Institute of infectious diseases in South Africa: in recent weeks, only 30% of the patients with covid-19 were serious diseases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; The average length of stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; Only 3% of the recent covid-19 patients died, while 20% of the early outbreaks in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of health, quoted data from the National Institute of infectious diseases and other reports as saying: "at present, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease."
He also said, "it is still early, and we need to obtain later data.
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only have two weeks to enter this epidemic. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although delta is still the main covid-19 strain in the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epidemic center.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Gauteng Province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy with the famous public service advertisement saying "no sale, no killing," then in a good environment without the demand for "abduction," mass prevention and mass treatment, and anti abduction by the whole people will make abduction and trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the emergency release platform for children's missing information developed by the Anti abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of public security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of children's missing information and timely recover abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "reunion," I suddenly feel warm.
New technological means are not only named "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also properly applied, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti abduction law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words."
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
There are priorities. Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help," controversial topics such as "whether abduction and trafficking of children should be subject to the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed carefully; But the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to leaving the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the abduction search is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step away from his parents, and the difficulty of case detection will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "reunion" platform, which is directly conducive to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "cracking down on abductions" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of justice, as well as the meticulous law enforcement, we all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child abduction and trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at the railway station. Their parents are asleep and wake up to find that their children are missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns to rest, or put their children under safe protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party who buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the criminal law of our country, the legal starting point of the crime of abducting and selling children is 5 years; If the circumstances are especially serious, he may be sentenced to death and concurrently be sentenced to confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. Under the general trend of "light punishment," the crime of abducting and selling children obviously belongs to the crime of heavier punishment.
But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the concept of raising children and have weak legal awareness.
The legal education of these people should be followed up at the same time.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the official strict law enforcement.
If the "market" for abduction is widespread, and the abductors are greedy for profits, constantly innovate the means of abduction and trafficking, and form a "law fight" situation with law enforcers, the anti abduction action is bound to fall into the mud of low efficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward ideas and popularizing legal common sense will also help eradicate the crime of abducting and selling children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five levels.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and filtering to remove foreign matters.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil: it is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with light and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is no more than 1%.
Fine virgin olive oil: slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: the taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or become "secondary oil."
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive oil: refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to reconcile taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5%, showing a transparent light golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or refined olive pomace oil: olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution method and refined.
Having seen the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like grapes for making wine. Olive fruit from different producing areas and different olive fruit varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place for olive to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation for olive growth.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on. Similar to its climate, Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on are far away in the southern latitude.
Olive picking month:
From March to June every year, it is the time for olive trees to bloom and set fruits. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, and the fruits transition from green to red, purple, and finally turn black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional ingredients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
At the end of the democracy summit, Biden said that the fire of freedom will never go out
The online "summit for democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, ended on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the autocratic regime can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and a councilor, and Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said, "we know how arduous the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The autocratic regime can never extinguish the micro fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said, "as leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrail of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better withstand the buffer and impact of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "democracy summit" are to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and confront authoritarianism, as well as counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day."
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges in the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "it is time to reaffirm common values and positions as well as democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Luo Guancong, a Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, addressed the summit through a pre recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and Chinese minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "for a long time, the world has accepted the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said, "maybe some of you are afraid of annoying General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you don't realize the threat of (the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Tang Feng, administrative Councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, attended the roundtable discussion on "combating digital dictatorship and affirming the value of democracy," and released the "national statement" by video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "at a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without closing the city, and we can defeat false information without getting off the shelves. "
Just as the agenda of the second day of the "democracy summit" was going on, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have seriously violated human rights, and impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the saliva chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to practice at the same price first.
Unfriendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then expensive rackets will normally be more friendly than cheap rackets. This kind of "entry-level rackets" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low. When the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. The hard ball can't stand it, and it's difficult for masters to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult. I know you can't learn it, and I know you're not willing to buy expensive ones. Make a bargain to fool you. If you play it twice, you won't play it again. In this way, the racket is cheap, and you don't feel distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to buy a second-hand better racket at a similar price, and choose prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can't sell at a price. A new racket of 500 or 600 is very good, and a second-hand racket of 200 yuan. Isn't it delicious to have a thousand yuan racket?
It's very friendly to novices, but it's useless after the novice stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the novice stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed for many times

In fact, there is a lot of attention to the dressing and matching of girls who are slightly fat.
The skirt worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. The length is almost at the knee, just enough to cover the fat part of the thigh.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
Too long will give people the feeling of short and fat.
If you wear the upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you are naturally taller, that is, if you use different colors for your upper body, skirt and stockings, it will look like a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for obese girls (the author deeply understands this). Dark colors are also a good way to cover up your fat body. Noble and elegant black skirts are also the first choice for obese girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially black skirts, will make people think you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
Lest people get the feeling of obesity when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly overweight, we must talk about the tips of dressing and matching.
Fat girls should never wear tight skirts. In addition, the jacket should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, they should wear black stockings or mesh stockings (the kind of fine lattice), choose a soft printed flare skirt, and match it with a swing collar jacket, which can well cover up the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
When a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a coat with the same color as the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat figure.
Short skirts with high heels can make your legs look more slender. This is the most in collocation in summer!
If you are an MM with fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous jumpsuit skirt.
It can not only cover your belly, but also show your advantages.
A-line skirt will be very thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. The jacket should be tight, forming a sense of hierarchy will be thinner.
Simple white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Slightly fat girls can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as we can master the rules of dressing and matching, fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the changes in clothing collocation, we should also exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of obese girls one day earlier

The girl used as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "it's OK to think of skin injuries" - Xinhuanet
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square, on which the words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" are written.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly higher than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passers-by can use bows and arrows to shoot after paying.
This behavior caused heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an aggressive move only after she raised money for her sister, but this behavior is not worth advocating. After warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl street "arrow target" fund-raising defendant admonished
In the online picture, a girl with long hair stood in front of a large wooden board in the shape of "a." The words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" were written in black ink on the board. Her bank account, WeChat account, Alipay account, etc. were written on another board in front of her.
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believed that this was "eye-catching begging behavior," and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
"We found the situation when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, there were many onlookers."
In an interview with local media, the police of Tianshui police station near the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed up young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who is a "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl helped shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of operation expenses. Please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the publicity director of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, as the treatment still needs more than 300000 expenses, I couldn't think of a good way to raise money for the moment, so I made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target and the other was responsible for fighting, but they did not participate in it. During the whole process, no archery was found, but someone gathered and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police identified by the public security department that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
The person in charge said, "this eye-catching fund-raising method is not advocated."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest year in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was a popular article "look! Project managers can compete for gold medal Olympic projects," which mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match: moving bricks, going on business, staying up late are the daily work of project managers, and it is not a matter of fire fighting, carrying the pot, and apologizing.
An article that looks like a joke also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inadequacy of the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get rid of their difficulties in work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the 20-year development report of China's project management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national cumulative number of PMP® applicants was nearly 600,000, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global total number of PMP® holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past "old experience." The rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP test ensure the smooth flow of project management?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten fields and five process groups of project management and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management.
Many project managers often feed back the following problems: the project management awareness is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and I don't know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to implement in the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project procrastination; The members' division of labor is not clear, and the "old timers" in the team don't know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance. The communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to promote
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R & D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "China enterprise R & D management talent training demonstration base," came with the online course "R & D project manager special training camp."
[special training camp for R & D project managers] online course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower cost and less investment, and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
There is no evidence for words. You can first see how other students evaluate this course: this course is not only a professional explanation of the course content in simple terms by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei R & D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

A wide variety of red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts once again benefit consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumption power is becoming stronger, on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "double 12," home credit consumer finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "home credit") issued a rational consumption initiative to remind users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the consumer financial literacy survey and analysis report released by the people's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, Chinese residents perform well in financial consumption, but they show great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; According to the "debt situation report of young people in China" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 consumption report of young people in China" released by CCTV finance and economics, the young generation has great consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation shows a rational consumption trend as a whole, although it is quite different from the label of "excessive profligacy" pasted by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow the trend of consumption, which has caused excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, home credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to the regulatory call to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions.
Over the past years, home credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and imperceptibly guided the consumption needs of young people by launching innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic colleges and universities, helping them establish a rational consumption concept and reasonably plan their consumption needs, so as to help them accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the double 12, home credit reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misunderstanding of consumption lending, so as not to affect personal credit investigation and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan in advance and repay on time according to your ability.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life such as car purchase and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, home credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and appropriate lending, and become a lifelong reliable consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to meet common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Arab countries in the Gulf resolve their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of the requirement that they must unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, in order to meet common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725km long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate the supply chain.
Saudi Arabia's public investment fund (PIF) will invest US $5 billion in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth US $30 billion.
The visit of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to the Gulf countries coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers on rescuing the Iranian nuclear agreement called the joint comprehensive action plan (JCPOA) - an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab countries for believing that it could not solve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that it is flawed not to solve the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Against the background that the nuclear negotiations between the major powers and Iran failed to meet the aspirations of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia held direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, and at the same time put forward various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Yes, sir
It is said that the exhaust sound of super running in Xinshan District is the loudest!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar and Murcielago's next generation model - Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, and the road tax is more than ten thousand ringgit a year. Four wheel drive, why is it called lp700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, Xiaobian doesn't know. The data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It's probably that Xiaobian's myvi will reach 100km/h when it reaches 30km/h, hmm.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
Don't say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. Xiaobian has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (actually a little cool)
1km fuel cost is about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
The posture of getting on and off the bus should be practiced, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will be unable to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
If the engine is too loud, you will suddenly be deaf after getting off the bus. (but it's still cool)
The car body is too big. It will be very narrow when parking in an ordinary parking space. I'm afraid of being knocked by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (Xiaobian said it himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the super run of this video is not for sale, sorry!

Involving a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that cyclists all know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also one million!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of sports cars 911 and tens of millions of super cars Chiron in just a few minutes!
It makes sense to look at the results!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school running concepts and value pursuits accumulated for a long time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in a modern sense, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which rose in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply affected by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "serving the world with virtue, cultivating Qi and governing peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "building a strong country with learning."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important "supply side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan for comprehensively promoting the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines not only shows China's confidence and determination to move forward from a large country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to become one of the most popular universities in the world in a relatively short time, speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize "overtaking on corners"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the late development advantage, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school running quality; Second, cultural advantages, inherit the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in the past five thousand years, carry forward and develop excellent traditional culture, so as to condense strength, shape brand and improve image; Third, institutional advantages, give full play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal driving, pool consensus and joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
In particular, we should be aware that it is impossible to build a world-class university with thousands of schools. Each school must show its personality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages.
School running characteristics should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goal orientation, school running tradition and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running the school: first, highlight the training characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment integrating science and education and combining schools and enterprises, and form a full chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Third, highlight the school running system and social service characteristics, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the pan Zhejiang University industry university research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "seeking truth and innovation," the common values of "diligent study, moral cultivation, discernment and honesty" and the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University are "accepting rivers, enlightening truth and virtue, opening things to the former people, and building our country."
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "hainajiang River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "using the world's talents for my own use," and embodies the high-quality concept of learning from world-famous schools to educate people; "Enlightening truth and strengthening virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the encouragement of personality while pursuing truth; "People before opening things" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including not only the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also the reform and development, innovation and innovation; "Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and it says that universities should always share prosperity and disgrace with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of schooling.
"The wise listen to the silent, and the wise see the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, and let the university spirit interact with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At the time of NFT's rapid emergence, a new concept of encrypted community emerged.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "axie infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie infinity is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT. It is the NFT project with the highest trading volume at present, and has exceeded 3 billion US dollars so far.
According to tokenterminal data, axie infinity's daily income is more than $8.2 million, close to the glory of the king.
On August 6 this year, axie infinity officially said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "axie infinity" has passed a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contract, players are no longer a single role. In addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of investment target industries. First of all, we should choose industries with large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion; Secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future, and consider industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the market scale, how long the track is refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is "do the things right," that is, do things right.
The strategy lies in "do the right thing," that is, do the right thing.
Strategy lies in finding direction, and tactics lies in landing. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); For example, on top of improving customer retention (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); On the basis of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately pulling new ones; On the basis of improving dau (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country El Salvador designated bitcoin as the legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called "taproot," which improved the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that both photographers and makeup artists are aesthetic online. Fortunately, I met them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I found that I was also a "photo cheat."
Asian American groups complain about enrollment discrimination in three Ivy League schools including Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Jianmei) - more than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of education and the Department of justice on the 23rd to protest against discrimination against Asian applicants in the enrollment process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission conditions of famous American schools has doubled in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in the three famous American schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "discriminate against Asian students on a long-term basis and systematically" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" enrollment process.
Zhao Yukong said that the research of Saunders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among the three universities, Asian Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest proportion of Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua news agency that they expected the U.S. Department of education and the Department of justice to investigate after submitting the complaint, and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in enrollment after finding the facts.
They also hope that the complained colleges and universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change the enrollment policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three colleges and universities complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it complained about Harvard University's enrollment discrimination, but the U.S. Department of education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani Americans also participated in the appeal.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a plant located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After many on-site house visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family member of the house owner, on the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the receipt of the deposit for the sale of the plant, which stated, "if the buyer does not want to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double. Both parties agreed to sign the plant sales contract within a week."
However, after that, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sale and payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sales contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
When the deposit was paid and the house payment was ready, the seller refused to sell the house, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to Yuyao people's court.
After hearing, the court held that the failure of the two parties to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract by returning the deposit twice.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[lawyer reminds] the necessary duty of prudence should be performed in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should do its necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
After the "democracy summit" ended on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the "leading the people's democratic summit" held by the United States was "to draw an ideological line, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, oppose democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatist confrontation, and transfer domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', causing disastrous consequences.
'democracy 'has long become a' weapon of mass destruction 'for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held by video, and leaders of 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices in the world and in the United States. For example, it is criticized that some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, were invited to the meeting. Some people doubt that the real intention of the Biden government is not to organize the summit for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is morbid, and problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, ethnic contradictions, and polarization between the rich and the poor are getting worse." American democracy is a "rich game" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "as leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better withstand the buffer and impact of autocracy, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted. "We must constantly update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our era."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuous and worrying challenges."
The United States promised to launch a one-year action after the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "let all our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."

Nichang restaurant (wudaokou store)
[Mint] environment: regular [service bell] service: the dishes will be served soon. "Gufa Mara cake" is my must order. Mara cake is too fragrant, too soft and delicious. Friends who like desserts must try "Dongjiang cuttlefish stuffed with tofu pot." The soup is very delicious, and the tofu is very tender and inky...
Good taste, good meat, warm service
I haven't been to Richang for a long time, and the fruit is still so delicious & it's full of real materials. The first time I ordered barbecued pork bun was the southern taste of my favorite soft flour!
The pot rice is just dry and wet, and the amount is very sufficient. The signature tin foil chicken wings are as good as ever, the soup is also good, and the mustard is processed better...
Good taste, warm service, good meat
Many years ago, the old Nichang store was also a wanghong, Dongdan small building, wooden floor.
It always takes a long time to eat pot rice at the door. The casserole of pot rice is cracked...
I haven't eaten Nichang for several years, and the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the passenger flow.
It's rare to see a seat at the store. The quality of the dishes is as good as ever.
Good taste, good meat, good staple food
Nichang takeout.
[rice] meal: this dish is a little disappointed.
Three cups of chicken: there are a little more side dishes and a little less chicken.
The taste of the main tune is a little biased. If the bottom taste is not salty enough, it highlights the sweetness. You can make up your brain for sweetness + various spices and side dishes...
What is the drinking method of red brand whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collection, some people like food, and of course, some people like wine tasting. Red brand whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries at present, and red brand whisky has won the gold medal in the international wine competition.
Every bottle of red brand whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you will spoil its mellowness.
So how to drink red brand whisky?
Xiaobian will give you a brief introduction.
Red label whisky drinking method:
Johnnie Walker red whisky is blended from about 35 kinds of Scotch whisky. It has the characteristics of rich aroma and traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoked flavor in the rich aroma.
It tastes mellow and fresh, with a slight taste of vanilla and strong smoked malt.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red brand whisky has entered China. In order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, red brand whisky + cola or Sprite or Sunkist and other bubble drinks have become an enduring fashion.
In addition to neutralizing the sour taste, these sweet drinks can bring pleasure to people visually. Adding drinks can dilute the wine taste and change the taste.
Red whisky + sliced lemon + sugar (sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic Hongfangwei tastes a little sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon will bring fresh flavor to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be mixed according to personal taste preferences.
The above three kinds of whisky are the best way to drink red brand whisky. You can try them as a reference. I hope the introduction of Xiaobian can help you.
Educational thinking: how to make "learning tyrants" and "learning dregs" take their place in college examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the type of examination questions, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college examinations have been a "hot topic."
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, and their ability levels are different. In addition, their learning levels are different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings about the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination questions are single, with high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may pass the exam by concentrating on assault before the exam. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, there will be "learning dregs" who can pass the exam and even get high scores without investment at ordinary times; "Xueba" usually never misses classes, and his homework and notes are all good, and his exams are not much higher than the "strange status quo."
In this way, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflect that the problems existing in the university examination are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon to rush to prepare for the exam and find various ways to "get" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and get "key guidance" before the exam. Even it is not strange to bring a cheat sheet in the exam and ask the teacher to raise his hand after the exam.
In the author's opinion, as a guidance of teaching quality evaluation, measuring whether a university exam is qualified or not depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to comprehensively master the basic knowledge of a subject is the content of the university examination.
However, undergraduate knowledge is basically subject basic theory and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, there is little room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, I studied the basic knowledge of college mathematics, but now I'm still learning it, which is still the key."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject will form the examination paper as a whole. The examination marking is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the repetition of the examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty and ease of the questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test proposition has a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and ease and the question type, which can not only highlight the investigation of basic knowledge, but also take into account the ability examination, and carry out innovative design of the question type at the same time.
Examinations are the baton of university education. Students will have corresponding preparation plans for examinations. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' suggestions and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out discussions and self-examination of the course completion examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and audit links, refine the performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
To solve the problems of single type of examination questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is the issue that the university examination needs to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but kung fu is important in daily life. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation. If they have a thorough understanding of both sides, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a benign interaction, and the examination will be more realistic, so that "learning tyrants" and "learning dregs" can get their own way.
If you can't change the location of the branch for me, can you change it to delivery?
Then I don't have to pay more, do I?
Colleagues' orders have been delivered

What about GPS? Are you there
Mrs. Kim wedding photography (South Street store) has no branch for the time being
Before taking photos, because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice. The consultant Lan Lan patiently arranged the time for us.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are excellent.
It was the first time in my life that I made up formally. Wow, I can't believe it. I will become so beautiful one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry I can't remember their name) are super patient in makeup, and makeup is also very natural.
The location was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and I didn't feel very cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and immediately helped us tidy up if there was a little bad.
The photographer is also very humorous. I feel very happy after taking photos all day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, we really didn't mean to add photos at all. We directly added 24 photos in the set meal, and didn't add any (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos in the same time as me, added more than 10000 photos to more than 7000 set meals. At that time, I was stunned and afraid that I would choose too many)
Today, the photos were repaired, and LAN LAN sent them to me. I saw two of them and didn't feel very good. They immediately repaired them for me.
Comparing the photos taken by my sister before, I think I'm really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend you to take wedding photos of Mrs. Jin in Xuanhan!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Kim is grateful for you and sincerely wishes you happiness and a bright future!

3200 newborn babies in Sabah are out of stock due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Kota Kinabalu, November 11) Sabah National Registration Bureau said that since the stock of special anti-counterfeiting paper was used up, it has been unable to issue birth paper to newborn babies since early October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3200 so far.
However, the director of the Bureau, kerouaminus, promised that the information of all infants who had applied for birth registration paper had been recorded in the system and would be reissued when the anti-counterfeiting paper arrived next week.
At the press conference, he explained an online media report that the printing problem of raw paper in Sabah newspaper had occurred for 10 months.
He said that the relevant problems appeared two months ago, and Sarawak is also facing the same problems.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper were affected by the epidemic, resulting in the delay of delivery to China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspaper is different from that in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow stocks from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah and immediately print the final stage. It is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two more working days (December 20)."
"We will inform applicants to go to local branches to get birth registration paper."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24801 birth papers so far this year.
From more than 7 o'clock to now
Is that coming soon?
I mean food
I'm waiting opposite #PRS_ORG# again
OK, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready

Super convenient, just like opening it on the computer, it solves the problem of insufficient hard disk of my computer
The new solid-state mobile hard disk that just arrived today cannot be read by the mobile solid-state disk computer. The mobile solid-state disk computer does not recognize it, but can be read by the U disk computer.
The machine is light and handy, and its appearance is grand and beautiful.
I used it all afternoon today. The heat dissipation is very good. I basically don't feel hot. It runs very fast and kills 99% of users when I turn on it.
The battery is also very strong. It should be OK to stand by for 9 hours and use it for 4 hours. In short, I feel very happy to buy a machine of this quality at this price. I will add other functions when I find them later.
It looks very good.
In terms of performance, it will be evaluated after a period of time.
The machine is faster and bigger than expected. The rendering effect is powerful. I like it. I'll review it after a while
Yes, yes, I can find the serial number of the machine on Hong Kong**, and the quality should be OK.
**It doesn't feel big, it's heavy. It's not big if you can't hold it with one hand. It's a little bigger than 15.6 inches. It's really stable to run, and you can't feel the caton. The sound of fan cooling is love, very sensible, and it won't turn all the time like a game book
It's good. It's much cheaper than the official flagship store. I also gave it a backpack. I think it's good.
The service of the store was also good. I was reminded to update the BIOS and issued a * * in time.
Worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: very good heat dissipation, basically no heat Lightness: easy to carry Appearance material: Thinkpad traditional design, satisfactory
Reputable seller, carefully check the appearance of the whole machine, all interfaces, no traces of renovation or use, it is indeed a new American version machine, and the configuration is the same as the page.
Forgot to send my backpack, and immediately helped me reissue a backpack. Although it is not a standard original backpack, the service follow-up is enough to prove that it is a conscientious seller.
If a friend needs to buy a notebook, buy it back.
Appearance material: appearance atmosphere display effect: the screen resolution is OK, clear, light and thin degree: relatively textured, after all, the heavier things feel the better.
Heat dissipation effect: try it at the beginning and evaluate it later.
The keyboard is pretty good for typing. It also gives a mouse and a converter. This configuration is very affordable compared with that of the Bank of China. Generally speaking, it is cheap and beautiful. If the machine performance is used for a period of time, it will be evaluated

Education information: Beijing reduces the proportion of junior high school students with special skills in 2016 - Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of junior high school students in Beijing was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment proportion of specialty students, and the competition among specialty students is more intense.
Take Dongcheng District as an example. This year, the enrollment proportion of students with special skills from primary school to junior high school in this district will not exceed 5% of the enrollment plan of the whole district. The planned enrollment number is 380, and the proportion of students arriving at school will not exceed 10% of the enrollment plan of the school.
All students who have sports, art, science and technology expertise and register online are eligible to participate in the enrollment examination of specialty students.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement of last year, and sets up 1~2 examination places in each school district, a total of 13 examination places.
The test sites are divided into test areas, and the time periods are divided by hours. On the day of the test, students will enter the test sites according to the time periods and conduct the test in different test areas.
On May 23, the district education enrollment and examination center publicized the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can query the examination results online.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
No food received
The point is that I didn't eat tonight
If you can't deliver it, you can say it earlier

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone," the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document calling for strengthening the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) - the joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in port cities, requiring personnel who recently leave land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel who go to land border port cities should be tested for nucleic acid at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when the provinces, autonomous regions and cities determine the scope of port cities and make an announcement to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Bureau of disease prevention and control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the border residents of both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of regional differentiated management policies, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning, non implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formalistic regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold chain items in all links, non-standard management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the weaknesses in the prevention and control of port cities, do a good job in the prevention and control work without relaxation, scientifically and accurately, and organize and strengthen the input defense line of external defense.
The notice stressed that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work at the same time, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to therein include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in time.

The truth of the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the U.S. military - Xinhuanet
(video source: oil pipe)
On December 11, a micro documentary called "killing machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity after 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocents.
Abuse drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up murder teams.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to impose all kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects."
Crimes against humanity have aroused hatred among more Afghans.
As the video said, the American "war on terror" is "more anti-terrorism."
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's expose the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of "counter-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life. Although canning belongs to deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are the same, and there is no difference.
Then you will certainly ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of cans two years or more?
Or ask: why is the price difference between tinned and bagged so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers also say that the taste or taste of tinned clothes is different after eating out of this mentality!
Now let me tell you the reason why tinned clothes are expensive. Where is it?
Their raw materials are the same. Why is the price difference so large?
Because when pricing, most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of tinned goods to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote tinned rather than bagged.
And you think so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from?
You can imagine.
With the development of society, the market promotion expenses, such as the promotion personnel of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses, are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and the price of tinned clothes is also rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increased cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, hook up with doctors in the hospital by all means, and they will assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a listen.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such operation methods. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans on the premise that you have cans at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of tinned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. If the shelf life of tinned goods is the same as that of bagged goods after unpacking, it's just that it's not easy to preserve and get damp and deteriorate after unpacking.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful learning books.
Nowadays, many success books advocate the "best principle" - that is, assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
It means that we have crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it" at once.
For this reason, these books have a common feature - either work hard to the best, or do nothing at all; Either 100 or 0; Either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" will make anyone admit that it is "extremely correct," but 99% of people will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you should make up your mind to be a new person and make a 180 degree change," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conformist, conformist and refuse to change, you must shout "you want to change" in his ear. Undoubtedly, it is self-deception and casting pearls before swine.
The vast majority of people will be timid and hesitant in front of the word "change," and it is difficult to make up their minds; Or with a temporary impulse, they made a painful determination to "change" and took the first step bravely, but often the good times did not last long, and they failed in a short time, so it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "from tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this classic of "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people and makes the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way that may enable more ordinary people to embark on the road of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "turning small victories into big victories," that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your door, because it's always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to adhere to it, and as long as they adhere to everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second best principle" is a little longer.
In a word, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, in fact, it can inspire a few in the end; Only the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resources reserves increased by 7100 tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) - the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of agriculture and rural affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Mackerel," is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, affected by a large number of human hunting and the increasingly degraded water environment for naked carp breeding, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 was only 2592 tons.
Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "red list of Chinese species" in 2004.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibited any units, collectives and individuals from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carp and their products.
At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, cleaning up the main river channels into Qinghai Lake, designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" and other measures to continue to strengthen protection, the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of agriculture and rural affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp in Qinghai Lake have been artificially propagated and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the three rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of "one river, one river, and one lake."

I just saw an article about menstruation. It's too long.
Give science to men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual leave one day between the ages of 13-15, and amenorrhea at the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, they will come once a month regularly.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, with bad luck, the car will overturn (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people for three days, some people for a week; Some people flow less, some people have metrorrhagia; Some people don't respond, some people feel pain until the ambulance takes them away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not feeling pain before doesn't mean not feeling pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation can't be controlled. You can bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end. All you can do is suck blood with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. It is useless to eat ibuprofen before the physiological period begins. It can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to eat after dysmenorrhea begins.
Before the physiological period, it is easy to have diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If it's about the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason, you will basically have menstruation within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. In addition to sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 tablets. If you add the prepared portion in advance, there may be 50 tablets, not one tablet every month.
(modify here, the tampon does not need to be changed often, it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may be irritable, and ovulation may also be emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very unlucky. The body makes itself a stumbling block.
However, the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's also endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstrual discharge) and a new house is built next month, and the cycle begins again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades, it bleeds 24 hours a few days a month, and it also causes abdominal pain and low back pain. Who wants to?
But people can be born because their mother has menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed. Society brainwashed women as dirty and ashamed. Everyone thought that was it, but times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and thinks that the female body's preparation for life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think so. Men who have never experienced it, won't experience it in this life, and don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and unkind. How can this attitude be kind to their mother, and how can they think of their own children with kindness?
Finally, sisters, try tampons. They are really easy to use.
Today is the winter solstice festival. It's disappointing to send the wrong one
We need to order another meal for the children
I hope the store will check the products in its busy schedule
Is the foot bath numb with feet leaking electricity?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot baths are more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. Foot baths ranging from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan are dazzling, giving consumers a lot of choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot baths and other health care household appliances are selling well, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain potential safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt numb in the soles of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath. Unexpectedly, when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt numb in the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, and the pen actually lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this foot bath, which has been popular for a long time, now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, which people it is suitable for, and what materials it is made of to ensure that it is harmless.
However, generally speaking, foot baths will not have electrification problems, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when leaving the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a split foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, without any potential safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a pencil at will.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Headline - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (all media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held in Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to display the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of the all China Federation of supply and marketing cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the provincial people's Congress attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of engineering, grandly recommended at the opening ceremony that the source of lake red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Hunan, four rivers and five colored tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea and black tea have taken turns to promote the integration of tea tourism in the main tea producing areas, driving the income of tea farmers.
The geomantic omen turns, and the black tea works again.
Tea experts in the province said that after picking green tea and picking black tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has soared.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises that were authorized to use the trademark of "Hunan black tea," and Xinhua was fond of "the source of lake red."
In the Xinhua black tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "binglichun" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, there are many bright spots.
Xinhua black tea has been infused with the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and popular, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it. He couldn't bring it up because he couldn't park below
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "metaphysics is the way, and metaphysics is the tool" in the book of changes, which is translated from metaphysic by Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extension.
Ontology is to "study which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.

Ethics is a subject of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta ethics (to study the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), normative ethics (to judge different moral concepts, and to give moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, and summarizing from the observed patterns.
Its examination of ethics does not start from the expected theory, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the moral factors of this decision. It studies the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by vara and Montaigne.

Due to the publication of the "foreign code" series of works such as "Thailand's anecdotes," "India's anecdotes," "Japan's anecdotes" and "South Korea's anecdotes," it is known as a "suspense genius" in the industry, claiming to be "good at serious nonsense"
"Black under the lamp," also known as "Chinese anecdotes," "suspense genius" Yang Xing uses a new work "black under the lamp" to take you deeply into the bone marrow of Chinese folk customs. What kind of sad and beautiful love and hate songs are behind those legends that have been spread to this day?

Ding Zilin: to friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, especially since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994, which has not been interrupted so far.
Nowadays, the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become married and employed.
It is your righteous deeds that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop making humanitarian donations to our difficult group of Tiananmen mothers. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the all aesthetics free association and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project executors often cross.

The relief funds often fail to reach the June 4th Movement smoothly.
In 1994, at the suggestion of teacher Ding, the "Tiananmen mother" set up a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th orphan education fund." After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the "June 4th orphan elderly special poverty relief fund," which has been implemented until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations in the year of June 4th, from generous donations from individuals, and were supported by the Democracy Foundation of brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the reform through labor research foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims of the June 4th movement finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th movement.
During this period, China human rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that teacher Ding's call to stop the June 4th donation is for the consideration of donors. We are indeed some retired people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby thank teacher Ding for his "letter to friends."
We will respect the decision of the refugees, terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous colleagues who have insisted on giving generously and risking the risk of delivering humanitarian relief funds for many years.

Thanks for Dandan's approval. Your satisfaction can make us fully charged and continue to move forward. We will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
It is impeccable from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to the later stage.
Makeup artists are particularly delicate and will match your makeup according to your style. Cosmetics are also first-line brands.
Not to mention teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and two kittens accompany and play.
We work in Beijing. All the better studios in Beijing need to queue up half a year in advance. Colleagues have taken pictures in Beijing. After watching the film, I feel just so so.
I specially searched this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor. I think this is also a short version of most people. Photographer brother Liang will capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post design, an excellent team.
We and the people around us are full of praise.
My best friend has been recommended, and my best friend has just seen the negative and is also full of joy.
I hope such a studio will not be buried, and more people will find ta and shoot it in their own style, rather than the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling. They are both very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are the creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting

A programming Xiaobai who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, you'd better learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who have extremely weak self-control.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose self-study, but it will be more tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, it depends on the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution will be meaningless. Of course, the teaching staff of some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how this institution is and whether the courses explained are good or not.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't made a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and haven't graduated, or have graduated from computer major, then if there is enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but first, the learning cost is high, and second, the time invested is relatively large, which basically requires centralized training for 3-6 months.
But if it's what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the network are free, or there are many training resources in station b. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to study in a training institution. In this way, the study is not very laborious, the teacher explains in detail, and there are also special answers to questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal promotion quotas, and recommend to the company after learning, so that the later job interview process can also save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views. As I said earlier, because I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction and it's not detailed. If you have other things you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock. I saw it on the app

But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining"!
The plan of the day is in the morning. All the good things begin in the morning. I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and good luck, and keep a good mood all day long. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing, and having it was happiness; When I grew up, happiness was a goal, and when I reached it, I was happy; When I matured, I found that happiness was originally a state of mind, and understanding was happiness.
Be the truest and kindest yourself, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; Life is a road, go your own way; There are two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and being beautiful forever!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Most of the time, what binds you is not your ability, but your courage to face it positively.
Since we can't avoid it, we'd better face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you face the difficulties, the problem will be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia curators jointly hold the first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Guan) - the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the diriya contemporary art biennial, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the jax art district of diriya, northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated.
This Biennale is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, and Tian Xiaoyu, curator of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, serves as the artistic director.
According to the curator team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "crossing the river by feeling the stone," which metaphors the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: crossing the river by touching the stone, inheritance as an experiment, thinking on the edge, going to the public, a beautiful new world, and on the spirit of art.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art, performance art and other forms; The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted much attention. Some artists use recycled materials in novel ways to create, for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste in the "endless pictures of streams and mountains in the story series behind" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Diriya Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that this Biennale would establish an international dialogue, give global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Tian Fenyu said, "the goal of the Biennale is twofold, which can not only enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: overall planning and standardization of rural public welfare post management - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) - in order to continue to provide employment assistance to the poverty-stricken population and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty eradication, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the revitalization of rural areas and the management of rural public welfare posts, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Department of human resources and social security of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448300 rural public welfare jobs for the employment of rural poor groups such as poverty alleviation labor force, which plays an important role in helping the poverty alleviation people achieve employment income increase, consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improving the public service capacity of villages.
The new regulations are jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan people's social security, rural revitalization strategy and finance, which mainly standardize the target range, fund management, post development, post management and other aspects of grassroots recruitment of rural public welfare posts.
In terms of post development and setting, the new regulations are clear and set according to the principles of "setting posts according to needs, determining people by posts, dynamic management, total amount control," "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management."
The recruitment procedure must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre job training and post arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare posts should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the resettled personnel of rural public welfare posts; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

2. Although the Rightists have a successful era in history, it is not long, so it is short because giving a little sunshine makes them bright and drinking some boiled water makes them sweat; A little success will lead to Longwangshu, and a blow will lead to Mao's attachment.
But in terms of seeking truth from facts, the Rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. As for me, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much; Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that counter revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make money from political speculation are not Rightists, but bastards.
Talk about Zuo again.
Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the left has no such luck, because what the left wants is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the left madness while opposing the thief, and they were quite angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left epilepsy. They are all one track minded and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti thief and left epilepsy admit, why?
I tell my friends this way: when the anti thief scolds you for five cents, and when Zuo Dian scolds you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
He gradually drifted away from his ideal, and even the dragon slayer finally became a dragon.
I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom. China should be leftist as a whole due to the innate genes of history and culture.
The domestic rightists are free and pay attention to efficiency and development, while the leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States will fight on the left, which is estimated to continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, just praise it
Don't say anything. Huahua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US emperor not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The US emperor suppressed China's chip industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises in its allies to blockade China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence was that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in lower R & D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, resulting in a global disorder of chip supply chain shortages.
Nowadays, the "lack of core" has affected all major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the rise in the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip," more and more national technology giants began to move towards the road of "de beautification."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and Laos have made frequent moves recently and hosted the "chip summit"; It also invited the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocated funds to support the local technology giants in the United States. For example, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and opened chip foundry business.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take the "rice bowl" of TSMC.
The reason why Intel is so sure is that as an old technology giant of the United States, Intel has been deeply cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is bound to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of TSMC, dismissed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 master think tank forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made amazing remarks. For Intel's investment in building a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou had no scruples and said bluntly: Intel's construction of a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel's entry into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou still holds a grudge against Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the peak position in the world and the overlord in the semiconductor field in the world.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode. Chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by one factory. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing." It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a minion in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing sector of the chip industry, it was obvious that it looked down on TSMC and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer processing services at that time.
I didn't expect that the giants who despised wafer manufacturing services in those days will also start to do wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic that Intel has entered wafer foundry.
Today, the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally did not dare to stand still.
Today, TSMC has made a sprint towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
No more waiting
It's been 2 hours since 19:06<unk>
Today, let's watch some [strange hot searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February Erlong rise, Haoliyou price rise, and Hualala incident. Public opinion spreads to form a wave crest, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If secondary public opinion occurs, small humps will appear again.
They seem to be no different from the "evolution model of online public opinion" shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches in the same event, showing [solitary peak], [zigzag], [cliff].
[solitary peak] that is, artificial heating, quickly rushed to the hot search list, causing public concern; [zigzag] that is, periodic heating, ensuring that topics occupy the hot search list; [cliff] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search has played its "function," received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad. It must be that the unified batch of naval forces received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead to war and momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making, and the refined operation of black production accounts in batches and nodes, almost taking into account all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Regardless of all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Every walk will leave traces. We will dig out such traces together.
Data source: hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries found the first case of infection with Omicron virus - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of cases of infection with the Omicron strain of covid-19.
Mauritius first reported two cases of infection with the Omicron virus in the country on October 10.
According to Kelesh Jagutpal, Minister of health of Mauritius, one infected person was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; Another infected person, a local resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contacting a person who recently returned from a trip to South Africa.
After hospital isolation and treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected people turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that three cases of Omicron virus infection were confirmed for the first time in the country.
These three people are all students. They returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized due to mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron virus, the Serbian government has continuously strengthened prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense.
The Serbian Ministry of health also announced on the 10th that Pfizer covid-19 vaccine will be vaccinated for children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
Malawi's health minister, kumbeze chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had found three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 covid-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these three cases of infection.

Da Mei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th floor, happy home, No. 156 Huancheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend. Because of trust, I chose to have a look. At first, my budget was 70000 for basic decoration.
When I came to the store, I began a series of tricks.
This is the first time I went to the store. I just showed them my house type map. They didn't go to measure the house on the spot. Unexpectedly, they could quote me that 70000 yuan of my 135 house can be done. They probably showed me their materials and didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that as long as you arrive at the store, you will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you will never return it unless you have enough experience to fight with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big hole. I am a living example of being cheated. When my mind was impulsive, I paid more than 10000 deposits.
There are many problems in the quotation he gave me. 70000 does not include water and electricity transformation, nor does it include any doors and cabinets. The bathroom, and these three are the bulk of the cost of basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and let me sign the contract without making it clear at the beginning.
When I went to them to refund money, they showed a very experienced appearance, and there was a special small team to deal with you.
It's the customer's problem that they will bite to death in one bite anyway. They are completely irresponsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibilities and many details. I don't want to say them one by one. It's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because the house my friend decorated with them is also of poor quality. I'll calculate all kinds of expenses for you later.
Kengdad, they are the original deceptive dragon head decoration, which is now changed to Damei. It seems that they have gone bankrupt and changed to others.
So don't choose such a pit dad decoration company.
In the future, when you choose Baidu, look at these and check these consultations, because decoration is not cheap.
If you want to ask questions, please login or register first
It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews. For details, please see the merchant inclusion statement
Public comment Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, telephone number and business hours of Damei 360 integrated home decoration. Find a decoration company, and then go to public comment
It's so horrible. Please cancel the order if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes!
Isn't there any other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money in 5 to 10 days, you must be investigated.
I asked if I could cancel in less than 15 minutes

The Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great event on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua news agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Runjian) - astronomical science experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day.
The Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Beijing astronomer An Jiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the parent objects of the meteor shower are periodic comets, but the parent object of the Geminid meteor shower is asteroid faerton 3200, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "gestated" by comets.
Xiulipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert on astronomical science popularization, said that like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow. Together with the quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower, it is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A remarkable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids are slow, colorful, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual and astronomical photography beginners.
The Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at about 15:00 on December 14. The maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'colorful' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the brilliance will be slightly discounted.
The 14th is November 11 of the lunar calendar, and the moon phase is a convex moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight, but they should pay attention to keeping warm. "
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light damage and an open field of vision facing the northeast in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then observe visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so you don't have to keep staring at the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower during observation.
If friends who like photography want to shoot gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbusters', they had better choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, backup batteries and shutter wires are also essential. "
Xiulipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is the product of large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the sales volume of laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why we have such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Institute of electronic technology standardization and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative test of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
The data confirmed that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is receiving more and more attention, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the declining price of LCD TV, the price of laser TV on the market is mostly more than ten thousand yuan. With the upgrading of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It must be reasonable.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With the ultra short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize the 100 inch large screen experience in a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the calorific value is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra high definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of video and audio players. If you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing, you can judge by yourself, and you're afraid to listen to one side of the story.
In short, in order to get close to the screen, the ultra wide angle close focus projector laser TV has to use expensive ultra wide angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive. The price of 80 inches can basically be replaced by a 65 inch LCD.
Another thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for their eyes. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen by the eyes is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse it to the ceiling, your eyes can't see it. If you have to be serious, LCD TV is also diffuse "direct light." Isn't the ceiling illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot be imaged at all.
The hot spot (spot) effect of the high gain screen is just ignored. A large amount of light at a certain angle is reflected to the eyes, which is really uncomfortable.
The preferred quality store of the cultural photography visual aesthetics photography museum has no branch for the time being
After adding the WeChat appointment date, my little sister sent me the optional time schedule, and the reply information was relatively timely~
Before going to the store, I saw the shooting works, mostly outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved a lot of shooting styles.
After the day arrived, I simply exchanged my ideas with my little sister, patiently helped me try two sets of clothes in my tangled style, and finally decided to start makeup modeling ~ the photographer will put some props before shooting, guide the action, and strive for perfection in all details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with the specific shooting ideas, the shooting style is not what I want, but it should be good-looking
After shooting, the photographer will help select the photos and exchange the later style. I feel very careful.
The repaired film will take about half a month, waiting for the effect~
For the second time, I won the photo overlord meal activity [most of the clothes in the audience can choose one to shoot].
Finally, I chose a black yarn skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours. Makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the post-95 generation. He feels a little green and astringent. I hope he can give more suggestions in the future in terms of customer shooting action guidance. He is very talkative and the shooting process is quite pleasant.
Cultural photography visual aesthetics Photography Museum preferred quality store Reply
It's on the home page. Let's take a look at Queenie~
When you arrive at the store, first fill in the name and phone number, and then choose the clothes. You can choose any wedding dress. It's quite patient to change three or four sets of clothes. After choosing, the makeup takes a long time, and the service attitude is good. Later shooting will teach you how to pose. That is, the face is so big that it takes half a month to finish. It's sent in three or four days. It feels like it's no different from the original film
[environment] overall good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, inside which is the studio.
[service] very warm and careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you movements very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will take the initiative to make up for it.
[experience] maybe the shape is a little too much. Originally, double eyelids were pasted with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrow has also been shaved, which is a little embarrassing for those who don't thrush everyday.
The photos have been given for more than ten days, but the effect of the P picture is not very satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I'm not sure what style I want. I tried two sets and chose black dress. My little sister said this one was more Hepburn retro
After choosing the clothes, I began to make up. The hairdresser and makeup artist were super patient and helped me make up. The effect was very satisfactory
After finishing my makeup and hair, I began to take photos. The photographer instructed me to pose throughout the whole process. The process was very relaxed and harmonious
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite pictures as Jingxiu. My little brother said that the ending of the film within 15 years was very satisfied.
I haven't replied for 3 days... Because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay the freight every time now
You can exempt me first, and then charge my monthly fee after your investigation. Is that ok?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the supervision of insurance brokerage institutions (revised in 2015) " tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past three years, and the minimum limit is 50 million yuan before it can be established, which must be approved by the CIRC.
These three are actually very harsh. To sum up, they need to be strong, approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders should have a good style of work. As an insurance brokerage company, the applicant does not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all, there are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it is not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai super Mary 5 serious illness insurance. The claim adjuster and insurer are Hetai life insurance. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salesperson's wages, Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of policyholders, and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of salesperson's professionalism: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with strong professional requirements. Many Internet product customers can insure by themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, non insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when insuring, feeling that they are healthy or in line with, which is easy to have many hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Weibo" (like small umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable. What is unreliable is people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are also many misleading sales.
For example, there is nothing wrong with these marketing strategies: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million yuan, buying insurance for free mobile phones, and receiving 60000 serious illness insurance amount for free. However, they avoid the important points and don't tell the applicant that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month needs to be charged according to normal fees, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers don't know what they bought after deducting fees for one or two years.
Thinking it could cost 1 yuan, the insurance company paid 6 million yuan (the world lost pie).
The free mobile phone is only sent in the special policy number segment such as 66668888, and if the winning SMS is sent, he will not exchange it and no one will remind him.
(this is another pit for the policyholder) It is short-term to receive 60000 serious illness insurance for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. In case of serious illness, 6 universal why can't solve the problem, and later life begins to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So from a comprehensive point of view, there is no problem with the platform and the products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the subject should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products are also better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products and save 2000-3000 yuan / year for each premium.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, who has three years of enterprise management training experience, has served nearly 1000 enterprise users, and cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During insurance, I will shop around for customers, and try my best to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will arrange and trust insurance policies for customers, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the applicant independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "sense of ceremony," and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing," but there will also be a fatal problem when buying insurance in this way, that is, the subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

From the past to the present, I am opposed to any form of slander and abuse, and I can't accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such villains.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style of work that should be resisted first.
Since you began to send Facebook friend requests, and then published ridicule posts, and then you tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as appearance, figure, good breeding, what kind of strawberries to grow in bed, whether to insert or not, I... forget it.
How did I know that later I received a number of friends' comments about your Facebook friend's account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After the news I called the police was uploaded, you didn't stop at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your status. In our society, we need gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make such ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks. You can also continue to say that you just love and care about me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment. You can even continue to deny that it is not your plan or continue to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and can't stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need your comment.
I don't even think there will be any girl willing to let others humiliate herself in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said, you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's OK after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who don't even have basic morality will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I cut some messages for you to comment
No one can pretend to be you in your own post
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization

Vietnam people's Daily - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh is attending the third Vietnam national digital technology enterprise development forum
During the third Vietnam national digital technology enterprise development forum, two major meetings were held, and the discussion topics focused on the two themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19.
Nguyen Meng Hsiung, Minister of communications and media, said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 continued to spread, the number and operating income of Vietnam's digital technology enterprises continued to grow, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam cultivated the number of typical digital products to focus on solving the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology enterprises to take the responsibility of developing national digital transformation platforms. The task of developing these national digital platforms is to assume the national mission.
At the forum, leaders of various departments and state organs, enterprises, organizations and individuals who are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technology shared breakthrough ideas and solutions to mobilize and pool the resources of the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promote the national digital transformation, Zhu Hui's post epidemic economic recovery, etc.
In his speech at the forum, Premier fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation is the only way for the world and the objective demand of development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem. Digital transformation serves the whole people, so it needs to mobilize the participation of the whole people.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies need to be for the people and enterprises.
Premier fan Mingzheng stressed that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, with internal forces as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external forces as the important and breakthrough.
At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and help green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the establishment of databases to protect and promote national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, etc., and promote the digital transformation of banking, taxation, land management and development databases, logistics and other fields.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Premier fan Mingzheng asked governments, organs and enterprises at all levels to strengthen leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, improve their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system of digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises in the spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity and initiative.
During the forum, Premier fan Mingzheng attended the 2021 "made in Vietnam" excellent digital product award ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "made in Vietnam" digital product exhibition.

Unexpectedly, the house has a total of 11 floors, from the second floor to the ninth floor. Negative one and negative two are parking places, and parking during the day is free!
It's really not so good around. There are few hotel hardware stores, and the restaurant tastes so-so.
This elevator is also very speechless. Like the serious illness, it tosses back and forth from minus two to minus one. I keep pressing this floor, and it is also very speechless to go down from the safe passage to the first floor. It directly leads to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed, and the safe passage can't get out!
Unexpectedly, the home still needs to be improved, and there are many places that have not been developed.

This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after Luzhou water green comprehensive service area in Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8th.
So far, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.

The three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 multidimensional pro communist media multidimensional reports: the latest news on China U.S. relations: the latest satellite images show that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are assembling around China; U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to U.S. allies and enemies in the Indian Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea strategic situational awareness platform," a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform predicts that Carl Vinson will deploy in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that Carl Vinson has deployed with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is now cruising in the Pacific Ocean.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th fighter attack squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser Lake Champlain and the missile destroyer Stockdale.
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea strategic situational awareness platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the three US aircraft carriers were assembling around China.
(Weibo @ strategic situational awareness in the South China Sea) The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo @ strategic situational awareness in the South China Sea) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal visited Guam on a rare occasion last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. The analysis said that this sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the India Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, and demonstrated the ability, flexibility, combat readiness of the United States, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indian Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of 14 "thundering submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make "thundering submarines" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear trinity." This system also includes ballistic missiles in silos located in the United States, as well as bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are meta traffic channels.
Not only that, meta is also the largest "advertising alliance." Many apps are connected to meta's advertising, which is realized through meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, meta is difficult to get users' data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and will obviously prompt users whether to allow apps to access their own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs again, it will have a greater impact on meta's revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in meta's income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of meta's revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
Meta has about hundreds of offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to meta.
Interestingly, byte TT is now one of meta's main competitors, but meta can make a lot of money from byte in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping byte to advertise in meta, and meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't learned about it recently, but it's definitely not better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but also depends on the future expectations.
Obviously, meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metauniverse."
Metauniverse should indeed be one of the directions in the future, but the implementation cycle of metauniverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of meta in these two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now, with an annual income of $100 billion to $200 billion, in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good security moat.
Although the daily life of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion is the blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of metauniverse has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changes the name of the company and keeps looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong and there is no way back. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
