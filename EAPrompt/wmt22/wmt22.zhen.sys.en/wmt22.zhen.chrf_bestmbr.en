Students play the leading role in the annual academic meeting of Zhejiang University, the research results make people's brains become open - Xinhua English.news.cn
Use the air to wash hands, diagnose diseases with a breath of breath, and accurately search for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brainstorming academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research has covered various fields including the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and so on. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at domestic and international level.
Biosensors: Your Home Physical Examiner
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smart phone-side biosensor onsite, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a light breath, and this instrument can initially detect the health status of your body from the composition of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming said that the set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biosensor uses graphene, a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health status of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lights: The doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"The early detection and inadequate excision of many diseases are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during the early cancer examination, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light discs that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under the illumination by adjusting the light spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the spot size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
The smart surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Run Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: water saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air hand washing device uncomfortable".
Just standing on the sink of the device, our body weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world, and won the only gold award.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides the driver's license!
Popularize it: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, the rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually still a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, or a respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
Therefore, the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there stupidly and unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is just so terrifying.
"In China, we have official figures of three million people dying from accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous one is called cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average national average of 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotels and hotels in Las Vegas, seven to eighty percent can be saved, and it is less than 1 percent in Shanghai and Beijing."
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person has sudden cardiac arrest, there is no breathing, no heartbeat, you pinching the person does not have any effect.
It is necessary to do artificial respiration and chest compressions to be able to save the person.
I found that very few of us still have this kind of awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when faced with emergencies.
It might even save someone's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals that I want to accomplish before I reach the age of 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was a matter of several months ago, but it is indeed completed!
Next, I will go to take test for other certificates I want to take, and plan to go to get a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate in Xiaohongshu before. It seems that you still need to have a first aid certificate before examing this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!

Let me start with the conclusion, I personally think that "The Four Seas" is an all-round bad movie in every sense.
But if you want to say whether this movie has no bright spot, it's not at least that the soundtrack is well selected.
There are many kinds of bad films, one that lets you fall asleep soundly in the movie theater is one type, one that makes you feel righteous indignation after watching itJames “The Four Seas” is like a monkey on Mount Emei to audiences. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really talented when it comes to insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a gram novel. It is indescribable, and there are many loopholes like the windbreaker on Ma's body.
Even after watching it you will wonder if there is any metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly talk about some of the things that I have a hard time understanding.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he lives together with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to watch the snow in a minivan.
Elderly people watching the snow from the south to the northeast in a van??
He and his father were also very relieved about this.
Then the old man stopped writing.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and his brother get the business license?
Why can the little gangsters of the speeding party on the island easily sealed a section of the mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road was stopped by the side of the road, and the truck driver could not even be found around.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a gangster gangster who has poor credit and is suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
In the face of loan sharks, why didn't the police call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sits outside the room door to sleep for the night?
These kinds of inexplicable plots are present throughout the entire film, and they are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Aside from the plot, what's even worse is the main point of the moviedefined, or that the film doesn't have a main point at all, just a hideous-looking Stitcher.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes you might guess that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through examination, you may think that it might be a drama that would reflect the difficult survival of the youth in the small town. After watching the movie, you would measuring in and have no idea what you've watched as a result. What followed was a deep suspicion of yourself, why the most New Year's Eve decided to go to the cinema to enjoy their shit.
For most people, they are actually familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then you would be inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie managed to achieve success step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, you can honestly tell about the grievances between the young man in the small town who likes to ride motorcycles and the girl who waited.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot have something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the character Yin Zheng played in whose new motorcycle was just burned, and can sing), then he couldn't get to some brain holes that even Kennedy could not stand watching.
As for the heroine, who is obviously not mentally retarded, but she acts like a 5-year-old child in some respects. I really don't know if this is because of her acting skills or what the director requests.
Another thing that I can't understand, as a racing driver, why is Han Han so keen to add crash scenes to his own movies?
Is it because such movies are arranged in the Spring Festival stalls to add congestion to the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment features and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspection well block brick making machine equipment is widely used in new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
Such as: various inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the upper, lower, left and right sides of the module construct concave and convex groove structures, and the combined masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the shaft wall is much better than the masonry form of the flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combined block masonry, the longitudinal holes are connected and the horizontal holes are connected. After the hole core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which playsUpdate the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are provided with grooves for inserting reinforcement bars vertically and horizontally, the horizontal and longitudinal reinforcement bars increase the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with the concrete inspection well module are not prone to collapse, subsidence, water leakage and other phenomena, and the well wall module has stable mechanical properties, simple operation, and standard forming dimensions.
The intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module block machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices, one-touch touch-type LCD display, and monitors the entire process of mechanical operation to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic pressure and conveying, and double-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the influence of the vibration of the main engine on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, distributing box moves, and the mold box is released and lifted, the storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically conveyed, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thus reducing the mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module block brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, and hydraulic parts of seals, to ensure the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration excitation platform of the well wall module adopts the integral plate steel, and the table has no welding point for line cutting and clamping, so that the stuffing box can be swing and guided freely and fully reduce the mechanical wear.
The mold load is reduced, the filling is combined into one to encrypt the amplitude, and the integrated, full synchronization, table vibration and mold vibration are adopted to ensure the vibration effect.
The mechanical vibration excitation machinery of the shaft wall module, and the computer automatically controls the amplitude to adjust the amplitude according to the cost performance of raw materials, and there is no wear-out braking, thereby prolonging the service life and reducing cost.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing secondary vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system, admission means prospective employees of the enterprise - Xinhua English.news.cn
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status. After the enrollment is entered, they will be pre-recorded as corporate employees by the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and recruitment procedures of vocational schools and company employment are standardized, and that the dual identities of apprentice students of the secondary vocational school and prospective employees of the company are defined. In accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and companies sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16, but have not reached the age of 18, the four parties must sign an agreement between the apprentice and guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party, the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of apprentice training on the job.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the form of modern apprenticeships to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, corporate master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training system as a pilot cycle. The internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the post-job internship is generally 6 months.
In the corporate practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has determined 60 pilot projects for municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeships in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprenticeship) have been trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot testing first, and then implementing them, gradually advancing from point to face, explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint student recruitment, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improve students’ job skills, and improve their counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron has strong transmission power but mostly mild symptoms
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the delta variant, although it spreads more rapidly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a physicians group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province in South Africa has reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating are showing mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughs and other flu-like symptoms.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organisation's director, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have yet required hospitalisation.
"They were able to control the disease at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
That includes older patients and those with medical conditions, who would otherwise be more at risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus, he said.
In comparison, in the last wave of delta outbreaks, he said, the Covid-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and had low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutant Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will still be several weeks before enough data is gathered, observations from doctors and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary by South Africa’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases: in recent weeks, only 30% of patients hospitalized with the new crown had severe illness, half of the severe proportion of the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent new crown patients, only 3% died, and among the cases in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death ratio reached 20%.
"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," said Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports.
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late data.
Typically hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain of coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases, according to health officials.
Thanks to the supporters today, all 80 boxes have been given away!

China Education Review: What to rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare it to the famous public service advertisement slogan "No buying, no killing," then in a favorable environment where there is no demand of "abducting abduction", mass prevention and control and all people fighting against abduction make trafficking unprofitable, risky, and cost high, and such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the platform for the emergency release of missing children’s information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for releasing information on missing children and to retrieve abducted children in a timely manner.
When I heard that this app is called "Reunion", I felt very warm勇.
New technology means are not only named "literary and artistic" and full of feelings, but also informatization is used properly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of cracking down abduction and law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated many "big words".
However, before the abduction and trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim.
Those matters have to be prioritized and under the urgent "rescue" purpose, the widely discussed and controversial topics such as "whether child abducting and trafficking should be all sent to death" can be put on hold for a little more careful discussion. However, the matter of the rescue of abducted children cannot be awaited.
According to the investigation and handling experience of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to stay away from the crime scene as soon as possible after they succeed.
If the search for abduction is delayed for an extra minute, the children may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will be increased by one point.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective method such as the "Reunion" platform that can directly help to detect cases and retrieve the child.
After all, "combating abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do well.
Fighting crimes and protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of judicial order, and the meticulous law enforcement, no need to implement the care of “nurturing children and helping the weak”.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three resting at a train station, the parents were fast asleep, and they woke up only to find that the child was missing.
A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a younger child, you should at least have some level of awareness of protection.
Taking turns between parents and taking a break or keeping their children under secure protection, are the least possible means of preventing child abduction.
From other side of the police's crackdown on the crime of abduction and trafficking, the party who purchases the abducted children should also be paid attention to trafficking and punished.
A single wrongful act is often only one link in a long chain.
According to China's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for child abduction is five years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the punishment may be the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The penalties are high and the maximum penalty is severe. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment.
However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concept of raising children and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the official and strict law enforcement.
If the “market” for abduction and abduction exists widely, and the traffickers are constantly innovating the means of trafficking and forming a “fighting” situation with the law enforcement, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking out backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge also helps to eradicate the crime of abduction, trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Virgin olive oil or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing, and filtering and other treatments to remove foreign matter.
There are three levels according to the different levels of acidity:
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with light and pleasant botanical aromas with an acidity of not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity of not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be classified into two grades:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent and light golden yellow.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): is an olive oil obtained by the dissolution method extracted from the oil residue and refined.
If you have seen the grade classification, you should have discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You must know that olive fruits are like grapes used to make wine. Olives from different producing areas and different olive fruit varieties, will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing places for olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions such as soil and air temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for the growth of olive oil.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be cultivated sporadically in suitable areas.
Main producing areas origin (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates are also far in the southern latitudes of Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on.
Picking months for olives:
From March to June every year, it is the time when olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February of the following year is the fruit picking season (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid,linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils and fats discovered so far.
The Democratic summit ends, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The virtual "Summit for Democracy", convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded Friday (Dec. 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom is burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and an authoritarian regime will never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "Democracy Summit" next year.
The Taiwanese government representative and political councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong, who are currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
"We know how difficult the job ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, the world of democracy is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the slight flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and push for reforms that enable transparent and accountable governance, more resistant to the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to run naked in pursuit of power before the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and fighting back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"The time has come to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, tackling inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, nativism and extremism in all its forms, including leveraging all the tools the technological revolution has to offer.”
Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Luo Guancong reminded attendees of continued concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For too long, the world has embraced China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything (resources) that we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our number one priority.”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change.”
Tang Feng, a political member of the Taiwan Executive Yuan, released the National Statement through video during a round table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming the Value of Democracy", emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experiences on how to fight against the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and took a leadership role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world," he said.
During the pandemic, global democracy is showing signs of going backwards as authoritarian governments everywhere rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interest.
In Taiwan, however, we can control the epidemic without having to close down the city, and we can defeat disinformation without taking it off the shelves.”
On the same day of the second day of the "Democracy Summit," the US Treasury Department announced that it was imposing sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were identified as severely violating human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have taken a picture and uploaded it to you
I know.
But the restaurants don't know why they keep delaying delivery times

i will definitely complain
If you can't deliver it, why didn't you tell me earlier?
waiting for you so long

Hello, the saliva chicken sent from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I won’t be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Is not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then the expensive normal case is more friendly than the cheap one. This kind of "starter shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low intensity, the ball hits the racket, and the vibration is too high, the hard ball cannot stand up, and it is difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn it, and know that you are reluctant to buy expensive ones or make a cheap one to fool you. When you play it twice, you won't play anymore. This way, this beat is cheap and you do not feel bad.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress, then come back to me to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket, and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets are not worth the price. New auctions would be just 500 and 600, and second-hand 200. Wouldn’t it be too pleasant to buy a thousand-yuan racketren?
It is very friendly to beginners, but once you pass the novice stage, it will be tasteless, but most people, especially girls, cannot get past the novice stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery time
Could you please help follow up?
postponed
thank you
That means, I actually already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Did I ignore the original order?

In fact, there is a lot of attention to the dress and matching for girls with slightly fat body.
The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long, and the length should be almost at the knees, just enough to cover the fat parts of the thighs.
The skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you wear it into three upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you will naturally increase in height, even if the upper body, skirt and stockings are made of different colors, it will look likely to produce a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark clothes are standard for fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, elegant black short skirts are also the first choice for fat girls.
Wearing dark colored clothes, especially short black skirts, can make you look thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So that people don't get the feeling of being fat when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fatter, they must talk about the tricks of dressing well.
Fat girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts. Also the tops should not be too short or tucked into the skirts, it will make people uncomfortable to look at. If your legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh socks (the kind with fine lattices). Choose a printed flared skirt with soft texture, and a top with a swinging collar to hide the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, fat girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
fat girls wear short skirts, they should choose a top with the same color as the short skirt, which will increase the height of your fat figure.
A short skirt with high heels can make your legs look more slender, this is the most IN match in summer!
If you are a MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover the big belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line short skirts will look thin, which is more suitable for fat girls. The tops should be selected that are tighter, forming a layered feeling that will make you look thinner.
Simple and simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, fat MM can also try it.
slightly fat girls can also wear fashion sense.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, then the slightly fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the change in clothing and matching, you should exercise more in your life, and strive to break away from the label of a fat girl one day sooner😄

Girl used an archery target to raise donations for her sister: "It's okay if I think it's a flesh wound " - Xinhua English.news.cn
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square is standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" exploded the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "target human flesh, ten yuan per arrow" are written on the board, indicating that passersby can use bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the publicity chief of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from The Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl had made such a radical move when she raised donations for her sister, but this behavior was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the street to "archery target" fundraising admonished
In the pictures posted on the Internet, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board with thePod epoxy character. On the wooden board is written the words "human flesh target, ten yuan an arrow" in black ink. On another board in front of her, her bank account, WeChat account, Alipay account number etc. are written on the board.
The image sparked controversy after the picture went online.
Some netizens believed that the move was "begging for eye-catching behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
"We discovered the situation when we patrolled around the square around 10 am on the 23rd, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
In an interview with the local media, the police from the Tianshui police station near the incident site stated that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were around 20 years old and dressed in youthful and beautiful looks.
Among them, the girl who was doing the "human flesh target" has been crying and begging passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting for the help, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needs operation expenses. Please help.
"We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising donations for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of the publicity officer of the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl, named Ji Jiali, was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required a cost of more than 300,000 yuan, I could not think of a good way to raise money, so this behavior was done.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was the target, and the other was in charge of hitting their hands, but they didn't participate in the process. During the whole process, no one was found to be shooting arrows, but some people were watching. They took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police identified by the public security department, the bow and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "This kind of donation-raising method of eyeballs is not advocated."
After being warned by the police station residents, she has already left the police station.

What's hottest in 2021?
Without a doubt it was the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A while ago, there was a very popular article “Look at the Olympic Games which Project Managers Can Strike To Gold Medal] . It mentioned that the project managers definitely can take the lead in many projects为此 and nobody else can match them up: Moving bricks, traveling on business and staying up all night are the daily routines of the project managers, and fighting fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are not a matter of crud.
The article that seems to be a joke, but it also pointed out the daily bitterness of the project managers, which represents the inability of the current project management work.
And the personnel who are engaged in project management work, are also gradually choosing to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament in their work.
Judging from the annual increase in the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professionals) applicants, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "Twenty Years of Development Report on Project Management in China (1999 - 2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China has nearly 600,000, the number of people who have passed PMP® certification is about 420,000, and there are about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certificate holder.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has been increasing year by year. This shows that more and more project managers丛realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the past "old experience", and the ever-changing working environment has taught us that we need to learn and explore the way forward while standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, does taking the PMP exam guarantee the smooth flow of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major fields of project management and five process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really implement project management work.

Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers on the Eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" carnival, the national online payment business transaction volume has reached 1.77 trillion yuan, a new record high compared to previous years.
The variety reduced red packets and the eye-catching live broadcast once again benefited consumers. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people lament that the national consumption power is becoming stronger and stronger, but on the other hand, they also have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and on contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Generally speaking, Chinese residents have a good performance in financial consumption, but they have great differences in different aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low and the "one old and one young" will remain the focus of continuous attention in financial education; The "Report on Indebtedness of Youth in China" published by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" issued by CCTV finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the younger generation presents a trend of rational consumption as a whole, although some young people are labelled "overexcessive" thus leading to as much social problems and greater financial pressure as they are leading to greater financial risks, financial risks emerge gradually,zipping and corresponding financial risks.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy life with high-quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to regulatory calls to improve consumers, especially young groups, with practical actions to raise the rational consumption awareness of the bunch.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people including college students, and has also carried out various forms such as in cooperation with Japan's top universities to launch innovation and practice competitions to guide the consumption needs of these young groups. This helps them to establish rational consumption concepts and rational planning of consumption demands, thereby helping them to accumulate wealth in life.
On the occasion of the Double Twelve, Home Credit reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and the correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid misunderstandings regarding consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit information and future economic life.
You must plan ahead when spending, and make repayments on time within your capabilities.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life such as car buying and house purchase in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterated financial products to provide consumers with more adapted and diversified services, continue to help the public to improve their financial knowledge level, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a life-long trustworthy consumer financial partner for consumers.

NDO - Gulf Cooperation Council - GCC addresses common challenges
The stops of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties to Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC, negatively impacting the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, where Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait towards "solidarity and stability."
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar by the two countries.
The Gulf Arab states bridging their differences to restore relations with Qatar stem from a demand for unity for the interests of the countries and regional stability, aimed at meeting common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$5 billion in Oman, and companies from the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as impossible resolve their missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has initiated direct negotiations with Iran against the background that nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failed to satisfy the wishes of various Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that is slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first of any GCC countries since the dispute between some member states with Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to allow its member countries to fully cooperate to face common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the peace and development of the Gulf states.

It is known as the loudest exhaust sound of supercars in the Xinshan District!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, and the replacement model of Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgits, and the annual road tax is more than ten thousand ringgits. Four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it, I don't know, the data says that it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It is probably that when my myvi will only reach 30km/h, others will reach 100km/h, umm Supreme.
The low body, arrogant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the unobstructed 6.5 v12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car model. Just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's too much attention, everyone is watching it wherever you go, so I’m very uncomfortable! (Actually, it’s a bit cool)
The fuel cost for 1km is around RM1 (the car owner does not care at all)
You should practice getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won’t be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half)
The sound of the engine is too loud, and I will deaf immediately after getting out of the car. (But still very cool)
The body is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in the ordinary parking space. I am afraid of being knocked on by the car next door when the door is opened!
It's a little lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said it by himself, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, please contact us!
For more car information you don't know, just in The Car Guide / People's Automotive Record
Involved in a car accident worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that all car fans know, the Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also millions!
That day, the foreign countries have knocked down one million sports car 911 and ten million supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, the expensive is justified!
Let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency - Xinhua English.news.cn
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by long-term accumulation of a university in the development process, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since its birth as the world’s first university in modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of “improving the moral merit of the world, and promoting harmony and peace” and took on the patriotic responsibility of “building up the country by promoting learning and strengthening the country凛”.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious, the competition in education, science and technology and talent competition continues to intensify globally. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges for its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of “Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines” demonstrates China’s confidence and determination to advance from a major country of higher education to a strong country in higher education, and also puts forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How to make efforts to rank among the world's first-class universities in a relatively short period of time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, so as to achieve "overtaking orExceeding on one curve"?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, goals, and abilities, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, late-comer advantage, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieving significant improvement in academic level and school-running quality; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom and connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather不行e strength, build brands and enhance images; third, institutional advantages: give full play to the institutional superiority of strong socialist countries, strengthen target-driven, gather consensus and synergy, optimize resource allocation and provide sustainable resources for schools to speed up and catch up with advanced world levels.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university with one thousand schools and one, each school must demonstrate their individuality and characteristics while giving play to their advantages.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientations, school running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on three outstanding features in running a school: firstly, accentuate the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent cultivation, build an integrated education environment integrated with the integration of science and education, and school-enterprise integration, to create a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlight the characteristics of cross-discipline convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and actively foster interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-products; third, highlight the characteristics of university running systems and social services, and carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate with the same frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "study diligently, cultivating morality, discernment, and truthfulness", and "Hainer rivers, inspiring truth and profound ethics, opening up myís and ministers to the people, and building our country up from the ground", together constitute the latest﹑state of the spiritual expression system of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school, continuously accumulate cultural heights and gather spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina Jianghe" emphasises the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which embodies the desire to "use the talents out of the world" and expresses the quality concepts of running schools and educating people in the world's top schools. "Inspiring the truth and goodness" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and to be kindness and meaning that while pursuing the truth, the University should receive the edification of morality and the cultivation of character; "New interests, the history of people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, innovation in scientific research, but also the commitment to reform and development. Dedication to national heritage and the nation must also bemoto-based, and the devotion to the promoting of the country and the nation.
These series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running education.
"The wise listen to the silence, and the bright see the invisible".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation of higher education and the historical mission it shoulders, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university, the spirit of the times, and the national spirit can stimulate each other, thereby providing an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of human beings.

When NFTs were quickly out of the circle, a new concept emerged in the encryption community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" has had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their job opportunities due to the epidemic began to gain stable income from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet development game based on blockchain technology, which integrates various gameplays including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion so far.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity’s daily income exceeds $8.2 million, which is close to "Honor of Kings".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially stated that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has delivered a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I read a news about a friend 's stock price, my biggest feeling is that the company chooses the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, we should choose industries with large growth potential, with a market size of at least 100 billion or more . In the second place, we must choose industries with good future growth, and consider the industries in which the growth rate of the industry will reach the best status in the next 3-5 years. Finally, we must choose an industry that has policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
Tactics are about "do the things right", which is doing things right.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about landing. On top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, above the rate of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether it should continue to deepen in the current field or extend it in the horizontal field (strategic thinking). For example, in order to enhance customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to investigating how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high value customers (strategic thinking甸 microscopy). In addition to improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct campaign goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurate new translation;结局, improving DAU (tactical thinking), considering whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years after its birth, Bitcoin has reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities Regulatory Commission approved ProShares’ launch of a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital market, and the exposure to cryptocurrency investments has expanded again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in the transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

Asian American groups file complaints against Yale and other three Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the three Ivy League schools — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College discriminate against Asian applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, the chairman of the group, said at the press conference that, in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of elite American schools has doubled, but in these three prestigious American universities, the proportion of Asian Americans has basically remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities have "persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian-American applicants" in their so-called "combine-based" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong introduced that in 2014, a study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in the three colleges and universities, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the Department of Education for the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates of Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be able to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions after deciding the facts.
They also expect that the colleges and universities being complained of will take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been complained have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Coalition was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the people participating in the complaint also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agency about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, after negotiating with family member Lin of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the factory, Mr. Lu remitted 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Lin signed the "Building Sales Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be designated to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory sales contract within one week."
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the house sale and purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
The house that was finally in his fabulous position, the deposit was paid, and the payment for the house was ready, just before the signing of the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
Following trial, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract and could not be blamed on the defendant only. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, the penalty penalty for the deposit should not be applied to this case, and the defendant does not need to assume the breach of contract liability for double the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer reminder】 You must exercise the necessary duty of prudence and care in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you must perform the necessary duty of prudent care, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house and whether the house is occupied by others and other relevant information, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, to prevent disputes between the parties during contract performance.
(DW Chinese website) After the "Democracy summit" concluded on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States holding the "Leaders Democracy Summit" was "delineating ideologies, tooling, weaponizing democracy, and in the name of fake democracy, it goes against the reality of democracy, incites division and confrontation, and diverts domestic conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, implemented 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted by video and invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of doubt internationally and in the United States. For example, some leaders who were invited to attend the meeting include leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect thatitol The real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes to organize this summit.
Newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participates in the video democracy summit
“The pathological morbidity of American-style democracy today is fully manifested. Problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and polarization between rich and poor have become intensified,” the Chinese foreign ministry statement on Saturday said, adding that American democracy is a “rich man game” based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the force of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not something to be taken for granted, "we must continue to renew it in each generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights around the world "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs champions to defend."
The United States has pledged to follow the democracy summit with a year-long initiative including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic institutions ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
"Let all of our countries deliver on our commitments and report on the progress we've made next year," Biden said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address

The old store in Richang was also an internet celebrity many years ago. It is a small building in Dongdan, with wooden floors.
There is always to wait a long time to eat the claypot rice at the door, and the casserole of the claypot rice cracked...
I haven’t been to Richang for several years, and the rise of Cantonese cuisine of various small restaurants has scattered the tourists flow.
It is rare to see that you will have a seat when you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is not to be mentioned and it is good as always.

What is the drinking method of red label whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collecting, some like food, and of course some people like wine tasting. The red brand whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in various countries, and the red brand whisky has won the gold medal of the International Wine Competition.
Every bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you are spoiling its flavour.
So how do you drink red label whisky?
Let me briefly introduce it to you.
How to drink Red Label whiskey:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended from about 35 Scotch whiskies, with a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoky aroma in the rich aroma.
The entrance is full-bodied and fresh, with hints of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This wine can be enjoyed straight over ice or mixed with your favorite drinks.
Red brand whisky entered into China, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, red brand whiskey + sparkling drinks such as Coke, Sprite or Sunkist have become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the sour flavor, can bring pleasure to people visually, adding the beverage can dilute the wine taste and change the taste.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar cube (granulated sugar is also available), is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic Hongfangwei tastes a little sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon will bring a fresh fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste hobbies.
The above three are the best ways to drink red brand whiskey. You can try it as a reference. I hope the introduction of the editor can help you.
Educational thinking: How to make "students" and "scumbags" their own place during the university examinations - Xinhua English.news.cn
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination and change the type of examination questions, so that the exam would really reflect the students' actual level of demand.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels, combined with different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
In the assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type and a high repetition rate, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to another completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the test through a concentrated attack before the exam. If they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve twice the result with half the effort.
In this way, it is a "strange situation" that the “skeletal skeleton” can usually pass the test without investment, or even get high marks; “Student masters” usually never fail堂 classes, and the homework and notes are good, and the exams are not much higher than that “strange situation”.
Seeing this, the students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University reported that the problems in the college examination are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only of Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote direct letters.
In fact, anyone who has attended college knows that it is not uncommon for people who have gone to university to prepare for an exam and seek out various ways to “trick” exam questions from teachers, trying to delineate the scope of the exams, and obtain “key tutoring” before exams. Even string-like cheat sheets in exams or asking teachers to lightly show their hands after exams are not uncommon.
In the author's opinion, as a guide for teaching quality assessment, to measure the pass or fail of a university examination depends on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be examined in the university examination.
However, the undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and common sense of the discipline. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
Just as some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still being learnt, and it is still the key point."
However, the knowledge points remain basically unchanged, which does not mean that the exam question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examinations are generally composed of question-setting groups, and then the senior teachers of the disciplines coordinate the preparation of examination papers, and the examination papers are also participated by all teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated examination questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of examination questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions are based on the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so that the examination proposition can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question types, and can not only highlight basic knowledge inspections, but also take into account ability assessments, and at the same time, innovatively designsMay flew on types of questions.
Exams are the baton of university education. What kind of examinations are there, and students will have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University hasOracle University attaches great importance to the letter of suggestion from students, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and post-course examination comparisons on self-checks, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper propositions and review links, refine the performance assessment, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
To solve the problems of single types of test questions and duplication of questions from a mechanism are issues that the university exam administration needs to face, of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced. But the work is more expensive in daily life and requires teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not only to understand the teaching content, but also the students’ learning situation. In order to understand both ends, teaching and learning will be better connected and a positive interaction will be formed. The examination will also be more realistic, so that the "school master" and the "student excluder" have their favorites.

Mrs. Jin Wedding Photography (South Street Store) has no branch yet
Before taking the photo, because we did not arrange the time well, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lan Lan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose to shoot on a weekend with good weather.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether the consultant, makeup artist or photographer were amazing.
It was the first time in my life that I had to officially wear makeup, and wow~ I can't believe I would be so good-looking one day lol.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry I can't remember the name) are super patient with makeup and their makeup is natural.
The exterior location was shot in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn’t feel cold. When taking pictures, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headwear from time to time, and would immediately help us to organize anything in case of a little bit of trouble.
The photographer is also very humorous, and I feel very happy after taking pictures all day long.
When selecting photos, because I saw many cases on the internet, we don't want the guests to delete too many photos. But when we chose photos, we really didn't want us to add photos at all. We didn't独家write any photos of any of the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos of the package of over seven thousand. I was shocked at that time, and I was really afraid that I would choose too many photos.)
Today, I had repaired the photos, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I saw two of them and thought they were not very good, so they immediately re-edited them for me.
I turned out and compared the photos that my sister took before. I think I am really very satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos with Mrs. Xuan Han Jin!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have you sincerely wish you happiness and prosperity, and a bright future!

I used it for one afternoon today, the heat dissipation is very good, I basically do not feel hot, and the running speed is very fast, and it kills 99% of users when it is turned on.
The battery is also very strong, with 9 hours of standby and 4 hours of use there should be no problem. In short, I feel very happy to buy a machine of this quality at this price, and I will add other functions when I discover it later.
The appearance is very good.
In terms of performance, it will be evaluated after using it after a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than expected, and the rendering effect picture is awesome, I like it, and I will review it after a while
Not bad, the serial number of the machine was found on the Hong Kong **, and the quality should be OK.
** It does not feel big, but heavy. It is really not big if one hand cannot grasp it, it is a little bigger than 15.6 inches, but it runs very stable, and doesn’t feel stuck, the sound of the fan cooling is love, it has a good feel, and it does not keep spinning like a game book
The things are good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and I also gave you a backpack, which I think is pretty good.
The store service is also good, reminding me to update the bios, and issued the ** in time.

If a friend needs to buy a notebook, they will repurchase it again.
Appearance material: Atmospheric appearance Display effect: The screen resolution is OK, clear, lightness: it is more textured, after all, the heavier the thing feels, the better.

48 hours nucleic acid negative, setting of a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document requesting to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (except those that are connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and those who have arrived in land border port cities must at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region意大利 and municipality determines the city scope of the ports and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified port cities may study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission’s Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the differentiated management policies by different regions has transformed from one line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the border forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been many local clusters of epidemic outbreaks in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this has exposed several problems such as untimely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some localities, incomplete implementation of closed-loop management of personnel at high-risk positions, and insufficient regular nucleic tests for nucleic acid testing, inadequate elimination of cold chain items in place, irregular management of centralized isolation sites and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that efforts should be undertaken from nine aspects including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, accelerated filling of the problems and weaknesses of the prevention and control of port cities, prevention and control work without relaxation, scientific and precise, and weaving close weave and strengthening defense lines against foreign output imports.
The notice emphasized that all port cities should simultaneously research and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and smooth the people's livelihood security hotline, and regularly check for potential hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and timely solve and actively respond to outstanding issues reported by the masses.residents
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (city, district, flag) that the open land, waterway, and air ports are located: the cities ( ecology's, prefectures, leagues ) and the municipalities where they are located . The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and will be announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video shows the truth about the bloodthirsty killings of the US military in 20 years - Xinhua English.news.cn
(Video source : You Tube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan War under the name of “anti-terrorism” and forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war. It used force, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committed various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Abusing drones to air raids on civilian places such as hospitals and schools, distorting human nature, and establishing killing teams.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" to inflict various kinds of torture and personal humiliation on the "suspects".
A series of crimes against humanity have inflamed more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terrorism" war is "The more anti-terror, the more terrorism."
The war did not bring hope of peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but brought only a devastated country and countless killings and destructions.
Poke the video, let us expose the truth about the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and uncover the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally read the following article which talks about why this customer asks a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspectives of business and shelf life, although the canning is processed by deep processing, not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company. The following article may explain why the customer wants to do it?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and have contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the powdered milk powder in bags and cans are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of the bag is one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask again: why is there such a big price difference between the price of cans and bags?
In fact, from this point, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is the better.
There are also consumers who reacted after eating them out of this mentality and said that the taste or taste of the cans was simply different!
Now let me tell you first about the reasons why listening outfits are expensive. Where is the price?
Why are they the same raw materials and why the price difference is so big?
Because when manufacturers set prices, most of them take into consideration that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or that there is no profit, so what can the manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of cans to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned packaging rather than bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions on advertising expenses or even hundreds of millions of dollars every year, where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion expenses of the market, such as salesmen at the shopping malls, display fees in shopping malls, gift fees for products, and advertising expenses, are also increasing continuously.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and it is also in canned packaging, and their prices are also rising continuously. In fact, they are new products that come out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increase in the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, pull out any means, link with doctors in hospitals, and they assist with the promotion of the products, with a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from a can.
However, relevant Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such a method of operation, in fact, this kind of practice is deceiving consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder and put them in the cans on the premise that you have a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing properties of the milk powder, which has no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of cans is longer than that of bags. If the shelf lives of cans and bags after the package are opened, the shelf life of the cans is the same as that of the bags, but the bags are not easy to store after opening, and easily deteriorated by moisture.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, dry and hard after it got cold, and the food is completely unable to eat.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua English.news.cn
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of successful studies books.
Most success books today preach "best principles"-that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you "what" you need to do.
It means to say that the “how to do it”, which is actually the most important and fundamental link, has been skipped.
That's why all of these books have one thing in common -- either do your best in an effort, or do nothing at all; either get a 100 or 0; either you climb to Mount Tai, or you just stay put.
This "best principle" will be admitted to "extremely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", and this is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For someone who sticks to the rules, follows the old rules and refuses to change, you are trying to shout "You want to change" in his ears, which is undoubtedly deceiving oneself and playing a piano to the bull.
The vast majority of people would show their timidity in front of the word "transformation", hold back and find it hard to make up their minds; or they would resign their determination to "transition" on a momentary impulse and take the first step bravely, but often the good times did not last long, and they failed after a long time. It was difficult to see the continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous cross talk "Starting From Tomorrow" is a classic that most vividly expresses this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's capabilities and makes the vast majority of people "walk away and sigh".
Perhaps the "second best principle" is an approach that may be able to put more ordinary people on the path of relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - which encourages a kind of "small wins for the big wins" theory, that is, if you can't achieved 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than nothing at all.
Since the threshold has been greatly lowered, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as you persevere in everything, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success by following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, although the "best principle" is supposed to make everyone succeed on the surface, it actually motivates a small number of people in the end; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resources reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human-induced mass killings and the deterioration of the breeding water environment of naked carps, the number of naked carps in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "Chinese Red List of Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibits sales of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial proliferation and release, cleaning the main rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake entering the lake, and designing scientific and reasonable “fish passages”, continued protection efforts have been continued. The reserves of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carps have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources exceeds 23%.
The Three Rivers source region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the eastward spreading of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three river source areas and the Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since the beginning of this year, and built a comprehensive management system for “one river, one river, and one lake”.

I just saw an article about menstruation period, it was too long.
A little science for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period someday between the ages of 13-15, and will have amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, on the premise of good health, I will come again even more regularly once a month.
But it is not regular enough to predict accurately. The tolerance of about a week or so needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the car will roll over in bad luck (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have three days, some have a week; some people have less flow and some people have massive bleeding; some people don’t respond; some people feel pain until they are taken away by ambulances. Dysmenorrhea will change over time. The pain in the past does not mean the pain in the entire life.
The menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a few days from the beginning to the end, and the only thing I can do is to use a sanitary pad or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent from flowing to the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen immediately when the menstrual period starts, before there is time to have dysmenorrhea, can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but it is useless to take it after the dysmenocorder begins.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about to the cycle, I have diarrhea inexplicably, and basically menstrual period will occur within two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, and you should remove sleeping time. The worst case is to replace it six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add preparations in advance, there may be 50 pieces, instead of one every month.
(Make a modification here, tampons do not need to be changed frequently, it can be changed once every five or six hours, and the longest is eight hours)
During menstruation, the hormonal disturbance may be more irritable, and the ovulation period will also be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body. That is, it is very unfortunate, the body makes troubles for itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems to make excuses.
It was not just blood that was flowing, it contained the shedding of the lining of the uterus.
After menstruation is over, the endometrium is the thinnest, which gradually thickens after that. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. A house is built every month (endometrium thickens) to welcome guests. If the guest does not come, they are completely demolished (menstruation is discharged) and a new house is built the next month, and the cycle starts again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day several days a month, and abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants to?
But people can be born because his mother has menstrual period. Menstruation is to prepare for the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed, and the society brainwashed women into crying that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the case, but the times have changed.
If someone thinks menstruation is disgusting, and that women's body is disgusting for the preparations they make for life, they shouldn't say it in public, girls stand up, stop thinking about it, men who have never experienced it, will never experience it in this life, and don't understand anything very well, don't be so ungrateful and not knowing what the hell will be, how can I be so embarrassed to face my mother and want my child through such an attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, it's really easy to use.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, it is disappointing to send the wrong delivery.
Have to order another meal for the children
I hope the store has to check the products during their busy schedule.
Is it a cause of electricity leakage due to numbness in the foot bath tub?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a very good role in foot health care. Today, the editor of Gome will answer this question, hoping that it will be helpful to friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot bath tubs have become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products at different grades have emerged in the market. The foot bath tubs ranging from more than one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan are full of variety, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health appliances such as foot bath basins are very popular, but there are no specific industry standards for foot bath basins, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrically charged water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath tub for his father as a birthday present, but when his father soaked his feet, the soles of his feet felt numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath tub. He didn't expect the vibration function to be turned off, but his father still felt numbness on the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with the electric pen, and the electric pen was actually turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the businessman, and the businessman’s attitude was not bad. Although he has returned the foot bath tub, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that the foot bath that has been popular for a long time does not have a clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the maximum temperature setting, what kind of people it is suitable for, and what materials are guaranteed to be harmless.
But under normal circumstances, the foot bath tub will not have the problem of electrification, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly checked when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bathtub when purchasing.
The separation of water and electricity, there is no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pencil to test.
The opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Video articles - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10th (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu Hu Panpan correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture, and accelerate the purpose of sprinting towards the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of Huhong is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea has injected new impetus into the "Five Colorful Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Hunans, four waters and five colors tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, and the major tea categories such as green tea, dark tea, and black tea have taken turns to make efforts. The main tea-producing areas promote the integration of tea and tourism, and drive the majority of tea farmers to increase income.
Fengshui turns, and the black tea is powerful again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province say that after picking green tea and black tea and dark tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea gardens has grown sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua hailed "the source of Lake Red".
In the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high mountain tea called "Bing Lichun" and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic situation and other factors affected the tea market more or less, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many bright spots.
The Xinhua tea has a touch of red, infused with the connotation of tea culture, booming in popularity and trading, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

you asked the restaurant to bring it up
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy something that's why I spend so much money for takeout
Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thank you to your friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I carried out an appeal for humanitarian assistance in my personal name to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Now the old parents of most of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and are employed by their families.
It was your acts of righteousness that helped us through the most difficult times as families in distress.
At the current time, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are already retirement.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop donating to our bereaved family-Tiananmen Mothers Group. This humanitarian aid activity should have come to a perfect end.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me my friends!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance services in both the China Federation of American Independent Media (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the All-American Federation of Independent States and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

The relief funds are often not delivered to the victims of the June 4th Movement smoothly.
In 1994, following the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Orphans' Relief Fund for Two Orphans in Special Hardship", which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects is mainly from campus and social donations during the June 4th Movement, as well as from the generous donations from individuals and supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Laogai Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, that the families of victims of the June Fourth finally received a donation from Hong Kong that raised part of the donation in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Human Rights in China was also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Master Ding stopped the donations for the 6th 4th June 4th donation because of donor’s consideration. We are indeed some retired old people whose income is not as abundant as before retirement. WeOne and I would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his letter “To friends”.
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families to terminate this program within two years and resume immediately if necessary.
We would like to express our thanks and respect to all the fellow chivalrous colleagues who have consistently given generously and risked their humanitarian aid over the years.

Thank you Rabbit for your comment. I originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn’t expect the finished product to be so beautiful
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity and move forward, and we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really amazing, highly recommend all my friends to come!
No matter whether from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography and post-production is impeccable.
The makeup artist is very delicate and will match your makeup according to your style. The cosmetics are also from the first-line big brands.
Not to mention Teacher Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We are working in Beijing and best photo studios in Beijing have to line up half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues shot in Beijing, and they were just so so after watching the finished film.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also a short version of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will capture the pictures and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, an excellent team.
When it came out into the film, we and the people around us were full of praise.
I have already recommended my girlfriend to go there, and my girlfriend was equally happy just after seeing the negative.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover ta and shoot it with their own style, rather than the same thing.
Thank you very much Zhanying and Jingling for their five-star reviews. Both of them are very innovative and creative newcomers. We are creative studios. As long as the customers like me, we will do our best to complete them. Thank you for meeting and meeting our customers.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice! It was a wonderful shoot, and an unforgettable experience, and the effect is much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comment. It is also a kind of fate to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, I trust us so much of the distance of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet all of you. I have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I give the money?
The redelivered meal has been delivered
no rider receives
Now the restaurant staff is calling me
A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do not have this idea, you may better study by yourself. After all, the training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to study.
But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those who have weak self-control, and training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to study by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important thing.
First of all, we should look at the teachers of this institution. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution would be meaningless. Of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong in the teaching staff.
Secondly, check about this training institution before choosing it, and it’s best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses explained are good or bad.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because I have not given a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your own situation.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated with a major in computer science, then I personally recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the lowest efficiency and cost method. Many offline and online training institutions are actually good, but the cost of first learning is high, and the second investment恙 is relatively long, and it basically requires 3-6 months of intensive training.
But if it is what I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the Internet are now free, or there are many training resources at station b. If you can not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also fine.
In addition, there are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer science major, but you can pay a certain amount of money and time for your learning, then it is recommended to study at a training institution, so that you will not have to struggle very much. The teachers will explain in great detail, and if you have questions, someone will answer them specifically. Besides, it is also helpful in studying planning or supervision.
And now, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal referrals, and after studying, you will be recommended to go to the company, so that the interview process of looking for a彤 can save a lot of trouble.
The above are some of my opinions, because I don't know your situation, I only give a general introduction and not detailed information. If you have anything else you want to consult, please feel free to contact me for communication.
I said be there before 1 o'clock, I saw it all in the app
what is it
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, lamp installations, glass cleaning, professional beauty sewing, and housekeeping services.

Life will not disappoint everyone who works hard, please follow me if you like, and thank those who silently give me praise
This is what life is like, others only look at the results, they support the process by themselves. Faced with life, we have nothing but to be strong, but to continue, we have no choice. We can look back at the road but cannot go back...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of intention.
Although we do the dirtiest job in cleaning, we will clean every corner of the customer’s home with the most serious attitude. Seeing satisfied smiles and thumbs up from customers, all the hard work will be worthwhile at that moment, and the efforts will ultimately pay off!

Give me a chance, you will definitely be satisfied, the quality says everything, because the profession is trustworthy, and your recognition is my most encouragement!
The current industries are not good for any business!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persist enough, and work hard enough, then I will be a little better than others, at least it’s better than sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, and all good things start in the early morning. I hope you will start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and good luck. Start a new day and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When I was young, happiness was a thing, it means happiness if you possessed it; when you grew up, happiness is a goal, and you can achieve them; when you mature, you realize that happiness is a state of mind, and happiness is all understanding.
Be the most authentic and kind yourself, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; take one path in life, and walk your own path; Two treasures in life: good health, good mood, and beautiful life to old age!
At every stage of life, you will encounter different challenges.
Many times, it is not the ability that restrains you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it calmly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face them, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators jointly hold the first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12. (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia – the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District, to the northwest of the capital of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places participated in the exhibition.
The Biennale is jointly planned by the Sauddirien Biennale Foundation and China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, with Tian Feiyu, the curator of the China UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is “Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones”, which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and it also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia’s social and cultural development.
The Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans over six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as Experiments, Thinking on the Edge, Going to the Public, Brave New World, and On the Spirit of Artweek.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits in this exhibition, including paintings, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists have also attracted attention. Some artists have used recycled materials in innovative ways. For example, in "The Story Behind the Series: Endless Landscape of Streams and Mountains" (2014), Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting from waste.
Barclay, CEO of Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this year's Biennale will establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have an opportunity to understand the booming cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and to strengthen interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is twofold. Being able to not only allow the Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation, but also to bring the Saudi audience into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the Biennale, where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Can I cancel the order?
I place the order again
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although there were periods of success for the Rightists in history, it was not that long, so the short is because they would become bright with a little sunshine, sweating with drink a little water; they would have themselves been only successful if they got a little aspirational, and fled when they were attacked.
But realistically speaking, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the aspects of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I dont completely agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I am very concerned about him, and respect Li Weidong very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.
However, I oppose his anti- Communist theory, I think that he is against a necessary revolution, and that revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, and various political groups will be established, furthermore, foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourth, to change or improve China, we must be patient and responsible for the country and the people. Those who attempt political speculation to reap our chestnuts from the fire are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left again.
The left, is actually a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Right is of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Right’s words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the Left will not have this fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dregs thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently I saw some friends fighting against thieves while refuting leftist cunts, and they are so really angry, I don't think that it is necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and Zuo epilepsy, because they剂量 all for nothing and they are unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting rebels and lefties to admit it, why bother?
I generally tell my friends this: When the rebel scold you for fifty cents, and when left madman scolds you as a right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their ideals or pursue them, but they will become paranoid.
And the ideal is getting further and further away, and even the dragon slayer eventually becomes a dragon.
I think that left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom, from the innate genes of history and culture of China, China should be left inclined as a whole.
While the domestic right wing is free and focuses on efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
Now society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the rivalry between China and the United States has a certain tendency to be left, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, just like it and it's over
Don't say anything, Huahua is just so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by the US imperialists has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US" companies.
The US emperor suppresses the Chinese chip industry, and requires its own companies and related companies in allied countries to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a reduction in the development of chip manufacturers’ investment and production capacity. Conflow thus led to a disorder of global chip supply chain shortages.
Today the "chip shortage" has spread to major industries around the world, such as the suspension of production by car companies, and the increase of the price of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected greatly.
In order to master the autonomy of "chip", technology giants in more and more countries are beginning to go down the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has made frequent蜡烛 moves recently, and is hosting the "chip summit"; it has also invited giants from 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance and made grants to support the domestic technology giants. For example, in order to regain the dominant position in the chip field, Intel, the old-fashioned technology giant Intel, spent US $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business.
When most people thought that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "job".
The reason for this conviction is that Intel, as a veteran technology giant of the US Empire, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, and possesses a large talent team and technical reserves. It will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, was dismissive of Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou's speech was surprising. Regarding Intel's move to invest in the construction of a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel is building a chip foundry, which was quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still holds on to a grudge between TSMC and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the U.S. imperialist manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and the world leader in the semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had always been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip design, manufacturing, and packaging and testing were all completed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overwhelmed some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only stay away from the huge production line construction costs.
Inspired by market demand, after entering in the 1980s, the chip industry began to see labor division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there is a company specialized in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing can be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
TSMC, which was just founded at that time, was a little boy in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou asked Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only involved in the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it had obvious high self-esteem and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now also starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic that Intel entered the foundry industry.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.

Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of the two dragons in February, the price increase of Orion, the event of pulling goods, and the expansion of public opinion formed a crest, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If the secondary public opinion occurs, a small hump will appear again.
They look similar to the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [lone peak shape], [Jagged shape], and [cliff shape].
[Empty peak shape] means artificially heating, and it quickly rushes into the hot search list to attract public attention; [jag shape] means periodic heating to ensure that the topic entrenches the hot search list; [cliff shape] means collective withdrawal, and the hot search has completed its "function", and he receives a new task and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the popularity of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time is equal to every minute. It must have been that a unified batch of navyFields have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which is in charge of popularizing, which diverts attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion and which coerces decision-making, and black accounts are inocks in batches and nodes and fine-tuned operations, taking almost all factors in the spread of public opinion into account.
Communication is a science, and regardless of the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, there will be nowhere to hide from the black public relations.
Everyone who walks there will leave traces, and we will dig out such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries discovered the first case of Omicron strain infection - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12. Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency's foreign reporters have reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the mutated new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in the country on the 10th.
According to Mauritian Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist who departed from South Africa and arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who was in contact with a person who had recently returned improved to South Africa, and tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons have both turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed three cases of Omicron strain infection for the first time in the country.
These three people are students. They returned from overseas travel earlier this month. Because they all had mild symptoms, they were not admitted to hospital.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron virus strains, the Serbian government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter by air will have to undergo nucleic acid testing at the airport at their own expense after arriving in Thailand.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate Pfizer’s new crown vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years old in the country.
Malawi Health Minister Kumbize Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has detected three cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time.
The country's health authorities conducted genome sequencing of 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 South Huancheng Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at it. At the beginning, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic decoration.
When I came to the store, a series of deceptive tricks started.
It was the first time when I visited the store and I just showed them my floor plan. They did not Journey to the shop to measure the house, they could actually offer me a quote for it to say that my 135 house is 70,000 yuan. They probably took a closer look at their materials, but I didn’t know what brand they are.
Their second trick is that as long as you come to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once the money is paid, you will never get it back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating about whether to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you as long as you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.
The quote he gave me had many problems. The price of 70,000 does not include electricity and water renovations, nor includes any doors, cabinets, bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of the base installation.
Apart from these, their service point charges are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company and they made me sign the contract without making anything clear at the beginning.
When I went to them to refund their money they appear to be very experienced, and have a small team dedicated to dealing with you.
Whether it will bite to death anyway is the customer's problem and they are completely not responsible.
There are all kinds of shirking responsibilities, there are many details, it is all tears if I don’t want to talk about them, in short, don’t choose them, because the houses my friend finds them to decorate are also of poor quality, so you will calculate the various expenses later.
Poor people, they were the faucet decorations that were originally deceptive, now they have been changed to Damei, and it seems that they have closed down and changed to other ones.
So everyone, don't choose such a foolish decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, please look at these more on Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not a small sum of money.
To ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first
It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant acceptance statement for details.
The public comment Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest business information such as Damei 360 integrated home improvement address, telephone number, business hours and so on. If you are looking for a decoration company decoration company, go to public comment
This is so terrible, if you don't order within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Isn't there another way? Like, for example, change the address?
Ok, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund my money within 5-10 days, you will be held accountable.
I asked if I could cancel it in less than 15 minutes

The starry sky has an appointment 丨 Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great time on the 14th - Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemispheres, the Geminid meteor shower, will usher in a great event on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the middle of the night.
The Geminid meteor shower photographed by Beijing astronomy enthusiast Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
The parent bodies of most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeton, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science popularization, said that like the Chinese New Year blockbuster, the Geminite meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release date" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
One of the distinguishing features of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids have relatively low speed, of rich colors, and there are also quite a few fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and for beginners in astrophotography.
The Geminid meteor shower taken by Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a maximum at around 15:00 on December 14th, with a maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly overhead) of 150.
The Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'falling rain' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the exciting level will be reduced a little.
On the 14th, the eleventh day of the lunar month is the lunar vehicle, and the moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in these few hours after the moon is behind in the second half of the night, but pay attention to preventing the cold and keep warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to conduct observations in cities. You can choose a place with a high altitude, less light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing the northeastern direction in the suburbs or villages, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe it visually.
It should be noted that the flow of the Geminid meteor shower is very large in all directions, so you don't have to keep staring at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
Friends who like photography want to shoot a brilliant "meteor shower blockbuster", it is best to choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
A tripod, spare batteries and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity.”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
From my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or the laser TVs themselves are products born for large-screens.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs are mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets users’ needs for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CMM's forecast, in 2020, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is less.
The ophthalmology experts from the Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the Peking Union Medical College Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a strict comparison experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions for the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection properties, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is gaining more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant drop in the price of LCD TVs, most of the prices of laser TVs currently available on the market are more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price has gradually climbed.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It definitely makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technological level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projection.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance, and the space required is not large, and the host is small and occupies very little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss to the equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It’s not about pseudo-demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not for video players. If you want to take into account the large screen and lack of viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and after weighing it, you can judge for yourself because you are afraid to hear one side’s word.
Simply put, the ultra wide-angle near-focus projector - the laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the microstructured Fresnel screen is used, which is very expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65-inch LCD.
One more point, I especially hate that the projection manufacturers make the diffusion reflection good to the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. You can’t see the diffuse reflection onto the ceiling and the eyes can’t see it. If you want to take a more realistic screen LCD TV is also diffusely “direct”, and when you turn on the TV, the ceiling will be illuminated too?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it will not be an image at all.
It is just that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery preferred quality store currently has no branches
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the lady will send me the optional time schedule, and the reply information will be more timely~
Before going to, I looked at the shooting works in the store, most of which were outdoor wedding dresses. The photos were very beautiful and there were many shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my youngest sister, and very patiently tried two sets of clothes that I was struggling with. I finally decided to start making up and styling ~ The photographer will set some props before shooting, guide the movements, and improve every detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas with me, the style I took was not the style I wanted, but it should be beautiful🙊🙊势力
After the shooting, the photographer will help choose the photos and communicate the post-production style, I feel very careful.
It will take about half a month for the repaired film, just wait for the effect~
This is the second time I won the photo-related Overlord Dinner event~ Most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece for the shooting.
Finally, I chose a black gauze skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process will take about 2 hours, makeup + shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting is a younger brother of the post-95 generation, and I feel a little green and I hope I can give customers more advice in the future on the guidance of shooting movements together~ I’m quite chatty and the shooting process is more pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio preferred quality store
On the home page, let's take a look at Queenie too~
When I arrive at the store, I fill in the name and phone number and choose clothes. I can choose wedding dresses, and it is quite patient after changing three or four outfits. After choosing, it takes a long time to make makeup and the service attitude is also good. Later on filming will teach you how to pose, but when I take photos, I feel that my face is very big. It takes half a month for the intensive repairs and it was sent in three or four days, and it feels as if it is no different from the original film.
【Environment】The overall is good.
Lots of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and there is a photo studio inside.
【Service】Very enthusiastic and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movements very carefully.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to offer to make a reshoot.
[Experience] Maybe the shape is a bit too much, and the original double eyelids were pasted with the triple eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit embarrassing for those who do not thrush their eyebrows everyday.
I have given the photos for ten days, but the effect of the P picture is not very satisfactory, and it feels like the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets. I picked about it, and I still went for the black dress. Miss Sister said that this set is more Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to apply makeup and hair. The hair stylist and the makeup artist are super patient and help me get it done. I am very satisfied with the result.
After getting makeup and hair I started taking pictures. The photographer instructed me to pose throughout the whole process. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming, I carefully selected four of my favorites to be the intensive repairs. The younger brother said that the film will be finished within 15 years and the ending is very satisfying~
No reply for 3 days... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan because your system does not recognize my credit card!睫
The weirdest thing is that I'm using the same credit card for every payment
I now have to pay the shipping every time
Can I waive it first, and then charge me my monthly fee after your investigation is completed, is that okay?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the脊椎动物 of setting conditions: According to the “Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)”, three key words must be met to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders and promoters must have no major violations records in the last three years, and the minimum amount of RMB50 million can only be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three items are actually very frustrating. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength, and must be approved by the national authority of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and Banks throughout the country), and shareholders must have a good style of conduct. As the small umbrella insurance of an insurance brokerage company, the insured does not have to question whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not. After all There are these three thresholds, which not all insurance companies can achieve.
At this point, it is not bad and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary No. 5 Critic Illness Insurance. Both the claimant and the underwriter are Hetai Life Insurance, and the small umbrella insurance is a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the payment model of view: products of the Internet platform, because there is less operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of salaries of salesmen, Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment methods are flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the payment pressure of insurance policyholders, and can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
can be considered.
From the professionalism point of view of clerks: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with very strong professional requirements, and many Internet product customers can apply for insurance themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings. In the area of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective awareness when applying for insurance, feeling that they are healthy or fit, so that there are many hidden dangers in claims and the risk of being rejected.
I myself have done an insurance telephone sale with “Tencent Micro Insurance” (which, like Little Umbrella, is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you this.
The Internet insurance is real and reliable, and it is people who are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example, 1 yuan for insurance cover of 6 million yuan, buying insurance for mobile phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid the important ones and will not tell the policyholder. One yuan for the first month and the next month should be charged normally, ranging from dozens to 200. Many customers deduct fees for one or two years and do not know what they bought by themselves.
I thought that I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (the world fell like a pie).
Free mobile phone is only sent to the special policy number section of the insurance policy ending number such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it will not be redeemed by itself, and no one will remind it.
(This is another pit for the insurance policyholder) The free coverage of 60,000 critical illness insurance is short-term. If you rely on this, and you have no other commercial insurance, if a serious illness occurs, what can you do with 60,000 because it cannot solve the problem? Life will start streaking in the future.
At present, the country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
So in general, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the subject should comprehensively consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose from more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers by myself, underwriting offline products, and saving 2000-3000 yuan/year in insurance premiums for each person.
If you have any questions, please feel welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker who has 3 years experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly one thousand corporate users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing an insurance, I will tailor insurance products for customers based on customer needs. During the insurance placement, I will shop around for customers, and try my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After insurance, I will organize insurance policies for customers and manage褶 them so that customers can feel at ease.
Together with each client, grow up with every customer for life.
Hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which an insurance applicant can independently complete all the insurance application process after clicking on the insurance application link.
In this process, the applicant does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, all steps can be completed by the insurance applicant independently.
Although Internet insurance investment does not have a “ceremonial sense”, and may not even have a printed version of the paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telephone sales" but there is also a fatal problem in purchasing insurance in this way, that is – the follow-up services may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that can accompany us for a long time and will provide us with services after many years?

thank you for your helping
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accepting such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to this kind of villain.
If you don't look at the political parties and factions, the first thing you have to resist is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, followed by ridiculous posts, and the last moment to your attempt to post my home location and father’s name on social media, I’ve taken a non-response attitude.
Then you intensified, and you have not only continued to tag me with the frequency of six meals a day, but also without restraint, on Facebook, and with your so-called friends, you continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, body shape, good fertility, how to grow strawberries in the bed, and whether you should insert them, so let me…forget it.
How could I know that later I received a lot of friends' messages from a number of friends about uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friends account and making comments that were sexual harassment.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer.
After the news I reported to the police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of playful, obscure, humiliating, abusive statement, you can continue saying you just love and follow me, you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even keep denying it wasn't your drawing and keep making all the offensive comments.
Yes, I cannot, and have no ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor do I want to know you, and I don't need your judgment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there is any girl who would want to humiliate herself so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, how are you okay?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can still say she is okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not even have basic morality would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the human heart.
I cut off some of the message for your comments
There should be no one can impersonate you that your own post.
All I can say is that you are the public enemy of civilization

The Three U.S. aircraft carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Multi-dimensional reports by pro-CCP media: the latest news on Sino-US relations:The latest satellite imagery shows that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US轴承 media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the satellites discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In the US aircraft carriers currently cruising the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the "Carl Vinson", there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3. (USS Abraham Lincoln).
The Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the above-mentioned two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, and the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China and visit Guam on a rare visit On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were assembling around China.
(Weibo @South China SeaStrategic Situational Awareness) The three US aircraft carriers assemble the most powerful weapons around China for a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight path of the U.S. US carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B.
(Weibo@南海Strategic Situational Awareness) According to another CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers have assembled the most powerful weapons around China and made a rare visit to Guam, analysis said, which is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three US aircraft carriers gather around China and assemble the most powerful weapons to make a rare visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarines".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thunder submarines" in the U.S. Navy's fleet are usually kept closely guarded.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," which also includes siloed ballistic missiles in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Chatting with friends about the recent Meta plunge of 26%, and the market value evaporated by US$251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that “facing unprecedented competition" What the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and revenue mainly comes from advertising. The advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertisements, and realize the realization of monetization through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain the user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertisement delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to obtain their own information. The normal response of most people is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the China factor in the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies that do overseas business.
Meta has about several hundred people in the Hong Kong office, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an inescapable advertising channel, and most of the money they burn is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't been looking into it specifically recently, but it definitely won't be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning cash overseas on a massive scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem isn't just the declining revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital markets not only look at income, but more importantly, what the future expectations are.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg spoke about the "metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Absent from the fact that Facebook is very beautiful now, it also has an annual revenue of US$100 billion to 200 billion. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat.
Although several of his social software currently have relatively high daily activities and are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the subversion is only The blink of an eye.
As for the elusive concept of the metaverse, there is absolutely no hope of success within a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks. The root reason, but I think his choice of tracks is wrong, it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts, for reference.
